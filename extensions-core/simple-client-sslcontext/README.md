This module contains a simple implementation of [SslContext](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/net/ssl/SSLContext.html)
that will be injected to be used with HttpClient that Druid nodes use internally to communicate with each other.
More details [here](http://druid.io/docs/latest/development/extensions-core/simple-client-sslcontext.html).
