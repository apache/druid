/**
 * Schema Repository is a registry service, you can register a string schema which gives back an schema id for it,
 * or lookup the schema with the schema id.
 * <p>
 * In order to get the "latest" schema or handle compatibility enforcement on changes there has to be some way to group
 * a set of schemas together and reason about the ordering of changes over these. <i>Subject</i> is introduced as
 * the formal notion of <i>group</i>, defined as an ordered collection of mutually compatible schemas, according to <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-1124?focusedCommentId=13503967&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13503967">
 * Scott Carey on AVRO-1124</a>.
 * <p>
 * So you can register an string schema to a specific subject, get an schema id, and then query the schema using the
 * subject and schema id pair. Working with Kafka and Avro, it's intuitive that using Kafka topic as subject name and an
 * incrementing integer as schema id, serialize and attach them to the message payload, or extract and deserialize from
 * message payload, which is implemented as {@link Avro1124SubjectAndIdConverter}.
 * <p>
 * You can implement your own SubjectAndIdConverter based on your scenario, such as using canonical name of avro schema
 * as subject name and incrementing short integer which serialized using varint.
