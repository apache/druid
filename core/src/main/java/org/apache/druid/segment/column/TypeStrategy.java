/**
 * TypeStrategy provides value comparison and binary serialization for Druid types. This can be obtained for ANY Druid
 * type via {@link TypeSignature#getStrategy()}.
 *
 * IMPORTANT!!! DO NOT USE THIS FOR WRITING COLUMNS, THERE ARE VERY LIKELY FAR BETTER WAYS TO DO THIS. However, if you
 * need to store a single value or small number of values, continue reading.
 *
 * ALSO IMPORTANT!!! This is primarily intended for writing ephemeral values within a single process, and is not
 * especially well suited (by itself) for persistent storage of data or cross process transfer. The support typically
 * necessary for such more persistent storage, such as tracking version of a format or endianness of the values, should
 * be handled externally to support these use cases.
 *
 * All implementations of this mechanism support reading and writing ONLY non-null values. To handle nulls inline with
 * your values, consider {@link NullableTypeStrategy}, which might be acceptable to use if you need to read and write
 * nullable values, AND, you have enough memory to burn a full byte for every value you want to store. It will store
 * values with a leading byte containing either {@link NullHandling#IS_NULL_BYTE} or
 * {@link NullHandling#IS_NOT_NULL_BYTE} as appropriate. If you have a lot of values to write and a lot of nulls,
 * consider alternative approaches to tracking your nulls instead.
 *
 * This mechanism allows using the natural {@link ByteBuffer#position()} and modify the underlying position as they
 * operate, and also random access reads are specific offets, which do not modify the underlying position. If a method
 * accepts an offset parameter, it does not modify the position, if not, it does.
 *
 * The only methods implementors are required to provide are {@link #read(ByteBuffer)},
 * {@link #write(ByteBuffer, Object, int)} and {@link #estimateSizeBytes(Object)}, default implementations are provided
 * to set and reset buffer positions as appropriate for the offset based methods, but may be overridden if a more
 * optimized implementation is needed.
 *
 * Implementations of this interface should be thread safe, but may not use {@link ByteBuffer} in a thread safe manner,
 * potentially modifying positions and limits, either temporarily or permanently depending on which set of methods is
 * called.
 *
 * This interface extends {@code Comparator<Object>} instead of {@code Comparator<T>} because trying to specialize the
 * type of the comparison method can run into issues for comparators of objects that can sometimes be of a different
 * java class type.  For example, {@code Comparator<Long>} cannot accept Integer objects in its comparison method
 * and there is no easy way for this interface definition to allow {@code TypeStrategy<Long>} to actually be a
 * {@code Comparator<Number>}.  So, we fall back to effectively erasing the generic type and having them all be
 * {@code Comparator<Object>}.
