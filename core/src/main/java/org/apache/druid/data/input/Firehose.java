/**
 * This is an interface that holds onto the stream of incoming data.  Realtime data ingestion is built around this
 * abstraction.
 *
 * This object acts a lot like an Iterator, but it doesn't extend the Iterator interface because it extends
 * Closeable and it is very important that the {@link #close()} method doesn't get forgotten, which is easy to do if
 * this gets passed around as an Iterator. Note that {@link #close()} doesn't cut the stream of rows for Firehose users
 * immediately, but rather stops the supply of new rows into internal buffers. {@link #hasMore()} and {@link #nextRow()}
 * are expected to operate for some time after (or concurrently with) {@link #close()} until the buffered events (if
 * any) run out.
 *
 * Concurrency:
 * The three methods {@link #hasMore()}, {@link #nextRow()} and {@link #commit()} are all called from the same thread.
 * {@link #commit()}, however, returns a callback which will be called on another thread. {@link #close()} might be
 * called concurrently from a thread different from the thread calling {@link #hasMore()}, {@link #nextRow()} and {@link
 * #commit()}.

   *
   * The Runnable is essentially just a lambda/closure that is run() after data supplied by this instance has
   * been committed on the writer side of this interface protocol.

   * A simple implementation of this interface might do nothing when run() is called
   * (in which case the same do-nothing instance can be returned every time), or
