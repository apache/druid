/**
 * This is an interface that holds onto the stream of incoming data.  Realtime data ingestion is built around this
 * abstraction.
 *
 * This object acts a lot like an Iterator, but it doesn't extend the Iterator interface because it extends
 * Closeable and it is very important that the {@link #close()} method doesn't get forgotten, which is easy to do if
 * this gets passed around as an Iterator. Note that {@link #close()} doesn't cut the stream of rows for Firehose users
 * immediately, but rather stops the supply of new rows into internal buffers. {@link #hasMore()} and {@link #nextRow()}
 * are expected to operate for some time after (or concurrently with) {@link #close()} until the buffered events (if
 * any) run out.
 *
 * Concurrency:
 * The two methods {@link #hasMore()} and {@link #nextRow()} are all called from the same thread.
 * {@link #close()} might be called concurrently from a thread different from the thread calling {@link #hasMore()}
 * and {@link #nextRow()}.
