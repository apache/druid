/**
 * An enum that provides a way for users to specify what encoding should be used when hashing strings.
 *
 * The main reason for thsi setting's existence is getting the best performance possible. When operating on memory
 * mapped segments -- which store strings as UTF-8 -- it is fastest to use "UTF8". When operating on the result of
 * expressions, or on an in-heap IncrementalIndex -- which use Java strings -- it is fastest to use "UTF16LE".
 *
 * This decision cannot be made locally, because different encodings do not generate equivalent hashes, and therefore
 * they are not mergeable. The decision must be made globally by the end user or by the SQL planner, and should be
 * based on where most input strings are expected to come from.
 *
 * Currently, UTF8 and UTF16LE are the only two options, because there are no situations where other options would be
 * higher-performing.
