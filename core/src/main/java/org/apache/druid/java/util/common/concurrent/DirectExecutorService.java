/**
 * Creates an executor service that runs each task in the thread that invokes {@code
 * execute/submit}, as in {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy} This applies both to individually submitted
 * tasks and to collections of tasks submitted via {@code invokeAll} or {@code invokeAny}. In the
 * latter case, tasks will run serially on the calling thread. Tasks are run to completion before
 * a {@code Future} is returned to the caller (unless the executor has been shutdown).
 *
 * <p>Although all tasks are immediately executed in the thread that submitted the task, this
 * {@code ExecutorService} imposes a small locking overhead on each task submission in order to
 * implement shutdown and termination behavior.
 *
 * <p>The implementation deviates from the {@code ExecutorService} specification with regards to
 * the {@code shutdownNow} method. First, "best-effort" with regards to canceling running tasks is
 * implemented as "no-effort". No interrupts or other attempts are made to stop threads executing
 * tasks. Second, the returned list will always be empty, as any submitted task is considered to
 * have started execution. This applies also to tasks given to {@code invokeAll} or {@code
 * invokeAny} which are pending serial execution, even the subset of the tasks that have not yet
 * started execution. It is unclear from the {@code ExecutorService} specification if these should
 * be included, and it's much easier to implement the interpretation that they not be. Finally, a
 * call to {@code shutdown} or {@code shutdownNow} may result in concurrent calls to {@code
 * invokeAll/invokeAny} throwing RejectedExecutionException, although a subset of the tasks may
 * already have been executed.
