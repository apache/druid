This Apache Druid extension enables Druid to ingest and understand the Apache Avro data format. Make sure to [include](../../development/extensions.md#loading-extensions) `druid-avro-extensions` as an extension.

The `druid-avro-extensions` provides two Avro Parsers for stream ingestion and Hadoop batch ingestion.
See [Avro Hadoop Parser](../../ingestion/data-formats.md#avro-hadoop-parser)
and [Avro Stream Parser](../../ingestion/data-formats.md#avro-stream-parser)
for details.
