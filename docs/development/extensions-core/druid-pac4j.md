Apache Druid Extension to enable [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) based Authentication for Druid Processes using [pac4j](https://github.com/pac4j/pac4j) as the underlying client library.
This can be used  with any authentication server that supports same e.g. [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/).
