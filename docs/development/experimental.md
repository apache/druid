Features often start out in "experimental" status that indicates they are still evolving.
This can mean any of the following things:

1. The feature's API may change even in minor releases or patch releases.
2. The feature may have known "missing" pieces that will be added later.
3. The feature may or may not have received full battle-testing in production environments.

All experimental features are optional.

Note that not all of these points apply to every experimental feature. Some have been battle-tested in terms of
implementation, but are still marked experimental due to an evolving API. Please check the documentation for each
feature for full details.
