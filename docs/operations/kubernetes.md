Apache Druid distribution is also available as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/druid) . For example, you can obtain release 0.16.0-incubating using the command below.

```
$docker pull apache/druid:0.16.0-incubating
```

[druid-operator](https://github.com/druid-io/druid-operator) can be used to manage a Druid cluster on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) .

Druid clusters deployed on Kubernetes can function without Zookeeper using [druidâ€“kubernetes-extensions](../development/extensions-core/kubernetes.md) .
