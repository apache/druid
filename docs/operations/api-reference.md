This page documents all of the API endpoints for each Druid service type.

## Common

The following endpoints are supported by all processes.

### Process information

#### GET

* `/status`

Returns the Druid version, loaded extensions, memory used, total memory and other useful information about the process.

* `/status/health`

An endpoint that always returns a boolean "true" value with a 200 OK response, useful for automated health checks.

* `/status/properties`

Returns the current configuration properties of the process.

* `/status/selfDiscovered/status`

Returns a JSON map of the form `{"selfDiscovered": true/false}`, indicating whether the node has received a confirmation
from the central node discovery mechanism (currently ZooKeeper) of the Druid cluster that the node has been added to the
cluster. It is recommended to not consider a Druid node "healthy" or "ready" in automated deployment/container
management systems until it returns `{"selfDiscovered": true}` from this endpoint. This is because a node may be
isolated from the rest of the cluster due to network issues and it doesn't make sense to consider nodes "healthy" in
this case. Also, when nodes such as Brokers use ZooKeeper segment discovery for building their view of the Druid cluster
(as opposed to HTTP segment discovery), they may be unusable until the ZooKeeper client is fully initialized and starts
to receive data from the ZooKeeper cluster. `{"selfDiscovered": true}` is a proxy event indicating that the ZooKeeper
client on the node has started to receive data from the ZooKeeper cluster and it's expected that all segments and other
nodes will be discovered by this node timely from this point.

* `/status/selfDiscovered`

Similar to `/status/selfDiscovered/status`, but returns 200 OK response with empty body if the node has discovered itself
and 503 SERVICE UNAVAILABLE if the node hasn't discovered itself yet. This endpoint might be useful because some
monitoring checks such as AWS load balancer health checks are not able to look at the response body.

## Master Server

This section documents the API endpoints for the processes that reside on Master servers (Coordinators and Overlords)
in the suggested [three-server configuration](../design/processes.html#server-types).

### Coordinator

#### Leadership

##### GET

* `/druid/coordinator/v1/leader`

Returns the current leader Coordinator of the cluster.

* `/druid/coordinator/v1/isLeader`

Returns a JSON object with field "leader", either true or false, indicating if this server is the current leader
Coordinator of the cluster. In addition, returns HTTP 200 if the server is the current leader and HTTP 404 if not.
This is suitable for use as a load balancer status check if you only want the active leader to be considered in-service
at the load balancer.

#### Segment Loading

##### GET

* `/druid/coordinator/v1/loadstatus`

Returns the percentage of segments actually loaded in the cluster versus segments that should be loaded in the cluster.

 * `/druid/coordinator/v1/loadstatus?simple`

Returns the number of segments left to load until segments that should be loaded in the cluster are available for queries. This does not include segment replication counts.

* `/druid/coordinator/v1/loadstatus?full`

Returns the number of segments left to load in each tier until segments that should be loaded in the cluster are all available. This includes segment replication counts.

* `/druid/coordinator/v1/loadqueue`

Returns the ids of segments to load and drop for each Historical process.

* `/druid/coordinator/v1/loadqueue?simple`

Returns the number of segments to load and drop, as well as the total segment load and drop size in bytes for each Historical process.

* `/druid/coordinator/v1/loadqueue?full`

Returns the serialized JSON of segments to load and drop for each Historical process.


#### Segment Loading by Datasource

Note that all _interval_ query parameters are ISO 8601 strings (e.g., 2016-06-27/2016-06-28).
Also note that these APIs only guarantees that the segments are available at the time of the call. 
Segments can still become missing because of historical process failures or any other reasons afterward.

##### GET

* `/druid/coordinator/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}/loadstatus?forceMetadataRefresh={boolean}&interval={myInterval}`

Returns the percentage of segments actually loaded in the cluster versus segments that should be loaded in the cluster for the given 
datasource over the given interval (or last 2 weeks if interval is not given). `forceMetadataRefresh` is required to be set. 
Setting `forceMetadataRefresh` to true will force the coordinator to poll latest segment metadata from the metadata store 
(Note: `forceMetadataRefresh=true` refreshes Coordinator's metadata cache of all datasources. This can be a heavy operation in terms 
of the load on the metadata store but can be necessary to make sure that we verify all the latest segments' load status)
Setting `forceMetadataRefresh` to false will use the metadata cached on the coordinator from the last force/periodic refresh. 
If no used segments are found for the given inputs, this API returns `204 No Content`

 * `/druid/coordinator/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}/loadstatus?simple&forceMetadataRefresh={boolean}&interval={myInterval}`

Returns the number of segments left to load until segments that should be loaded in the cluster are available for the given datasource 
over the given interval (or last 2 weeks if interval is not given). This does not include segment replication counts. `forceMetadataRefresh` is required to be set. 
Setting `forceMetadataRefresh` to true will force the coordinator to poll latest segment metadata from the metadata store 
(Note: `forceMetadataRefresh=true` refreshes Coordinator's metadata cache of all datasources. This can be a heavy operation in terms 
of the load on the metadata store but can be necessary to make sure that we verify all the latest segments' load status)
Setting `forceMetadataRefresh` to false will use the metadata cached on the coordinator from the last force/periodic refresh. 
If no used segments are found for the given inputs, this API returns `204 No Content` 

* `/druid/coordinator/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}/loadstatus?full&forceMetadataRefresh={boolean}&interval={myInterval}`

Returns the number of segments left to load in each tier until segments that should be loaded in the cluster are all available for the given datasource 
over the given interval (or last 2 weeks if interval is not given). This includes segment replication counts. `forceMetadataRefresh` is required to be set. 
Setting `forceMetadataRefresh` to true will force the coordinator to poll latest segment metadata from the metadata store 
(Note: `forceMetadataRefresh=true` refreshes Coordinator's metadata cache of all datasources. This can be a heavy operation in terms 
of the load on the metadata store but can be necessary to make sure that we verify all the latest segments' load status)
Setting `forceMetadataRefresh` to false will use the metadata cached on the coordinator from the last force/periodic refresh. 
If no used segments are found for the given inputs, this API returns `204 No Content`

<a name="coordinator-datasources"></a>

#### Datasources

Note that all _interval_ URL parameters are ISO 8601 strings delimited by a `_` instead of a `/`
(e.g., 2016-06-27_2016-06-28).

Return the tiers that a datasource exists in.

#### Note for coordinator's POST and DELETE API's
The segments would be enabled when these API's are called, but then can be disabled again by the coordinator if any dropRule matches. Segments enabled by these API's might not be loaded by historical processes if no loadRule matches.  If an indexing or kill task runs at the same time as these API's are invoked, the behavior is undefined. Some segments might be killed and others might be enabled. It's also possible that all segments might be disabled but at the same time, the indexing task is able to read data from those segments and succeed.

Caution : Avoid using indexing or kill tasks and these API's at the same time for the same datasource and time chunk. (It's fine if the time chunks or datasource don't overlap)

##### POST

* `/druid/coordinator/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}`

Marks as used all segments belonging to a data source. Returns a JSON object of the form
`{"numChangedSegments": <number>}` with the number of segments in the database whose state has been changed (that is,
the segments were marked as used) as the result of this API call.

* `/druid/coordinator/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}/segments/{segmentId}`

Marks as used a segment of a data source. Returns a JSON object of the form `{"segmentStateChanged": <boolean>}` with
the boolean indicating if the state of the segment has been changed (that is, the segment was marked as used) as the
result of this API call.

* `/druid/coordinator/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}/markUsed`

* `/druid/coordinator/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}/markUnused`

Marks segments (un)used for a datasource by interval or set of segment Ids.

When marking used only segments that are not overshadowed will be updated.

The request payload contains the interval or set of segment Ids to be marked unused.
Either interval or segment ids should be provided, if both or none are provided in the payload, the API would throw an error (400 BAD REQUEST).

Interval specifies the start and end times as IS0 8601 strings. `interval=(start/end)` where start and end both are inclusive and only the segments completely contained within the specified interval will be disabled, partially overlapping segments will not be affected.

JSON Request Payload:

 |Key|Description|Example|
|----------|-------------|---------|
|`interval`|The interval for which to mark segments unused|"2015-09-12T03:00:00.000Z/2015-09-12T05:00:00.000Z"|
|`segmentIds`|Set of segment Ids to be marked unused|["segmentId1", "segmentId2"]|

##### DELETE

* `/druid/coordinator/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}`

Marks as unused all segments belonging to a data source. Returns a JSON object of the form
`{"numChangedSegments": <number>}` with the number of segments in the database whose state has been changed (that is,
the segments were marked as unused) as the result of this API call.

* `/druid/coordinator/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}/intervals/{interval}`
* `@Deprecated. /druid/coordinator/v1/datasources/{dataSourceName}?kill=true&interval={myInterval}`

* `/druid/indexer/v1/isLeader`

This returns a JSON object with field "leader", either true or false. In addition, this call returns HTTP 200 if the
server is the current leader and HTTP 404 if not. This is suitable for use as a load balancer status check if you
only want the active leader to be considered in-service at the load balancer.

#### Tasks

### Peon

#### GET

* `/druid/worker/v1/chat/{taskId}/rowStats`

* `/druid/worker/v1/chat/{taskId}/unparseableEvents`

Retrieve an unparseable events report from a Peon. See [task reports](../ingestion/tasks.md#task-reports) for more details.

### Historical

#### Segment Loading

##### GET

* `/druid/historical/v1/loadstatus`

Returns JSON of the form `{"cacheInitialized":<value>}`, where value is either `true` or `false` indicating if all
segments in the local cache have been loaded. This can be used to know when a Historical process is ready

in the local cache have been loaded, and 503 SERVICE UNAVAILABLE, if they haven't.


## Query Server

This section documents the API endpoints for the processes that reside on Query servers (Brokers) in the suggested [three-server configuration](../design/processes.html#server-types).

### Broker

#### Datasource Information

Note that all _interval_ URL parameters are ISO 8601 strings delimited by a `_` instead of a `/`
(e.g., 2016-06-27_2016-06-28).

##### GET

* `/druid/v2/datasources`

Returns a list of queryable datasources.

* `/druid/v2/datasources/{dataSourceName}`

Returns the dimensions and metrics of the datasource. Optionally, you can provide request parameter "full" to get list of served intervals with dimensions and metrics being served for those intervals. You can also provide request param "interval" explicitly to refer to a particular interval.

If no interval is specified, a default interval spanning a configurable period before the current time will be used. The default duration of this interval is specified in ISO 8601 duration format via:

druid.query.segmentMetadata.defaultHistory

* `/druid/v2/datasources/{dataSourceName}/dimensions`

Returns the dimensions of the datasource.

> This API is deprecated and will be removed in future releases. Please use [SegmentMetadataQuery](../querying/segmentmetadataquery.md) instead
> which provides more comprehensive information and supports all dataSource types including streaming dataSources. It's also encouraged to use [INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables](../querying/sql.md#metadata-tables)
> if you're using SQL.

* `/druid/v2/datasources/{dataSourceName}/metrics`

Returns the metrics of the datasource.

> if you're using SQL.

* `/druid/v2/datasources/{dataSourceName}/candidates?intervals={comma-separated-intervals}&numCandidates={numCandidates}`

Returns segment information lists including server locations for the given datasource and intervals. If "numCandidates" is not specified, it will return all servers for each interval.

#### Load Status

##### GET

* `/druid/broker/v1/loadstatus`
