The DumpSegment tool can be used to dump the metadata or contents of an Apache Druid segment for debugging purposes. Note that the
dump is not necessarily a full-fidelity translation of the segment. In particular, not all metadata is included, and
complex metric values may not be complete.

To run the tool, point it at a segment directory and provide a file for writing output:

```
java -classpath "/my/druid/lib/*" -Ddruid.extensions.loadList="[]" org.apache.druid.cli.Main \
  tools dump-segment \
  --directory /home/druid/path/to/segment/ \
  --out /home/druid/output.txt
```

### Output format

#### Data dumps

By default, or with `--dump rows`, this tool dumps rows of the segment as newline-separate JSON objects, with one
object per line, using the default serialization for each column. Normally all columns are included, but if you like,
you can limit the dump to specific columns with `--column name`.

For example, one line might look like this when pretty-printed:

```
{
  "__time": 1442018818771,
  "added": 36,
  "channel": "#en.wikipedia",
  "cityName": null,
  "comment": "added project",
  "count": 1,
  "countryIsoCode": null,
  "countryName": null,
  "deleted": 0,
  "delta": 36,
  "isAnonymous": "false",
  "isMinor": "false",
  "isNew": "false",
  "isRobot": "false",
  "isUnpatrolled": "false",
  "iuser": "00001553",
  "metroCode": null,
  "namespace": "Talk",
  "page": "Talk:Oswald Tilghman",
  "regionIsoCode": null,
  "regionName": null,
  "user": "GELongstreet"
}
```

#### Metadata dumps

With `--dump metadata`, this tool dumps metadata instead of rows. Metadata dumps generated by this tool are in the same
format as returned by the [SegmentMetadata query](../querying/segmentmetadataquery.md).

#### Bitmap dumps

With `--dump bitmaps`, this tool dump bitmap indexes instead of rows. Bitmap dumps generated by this tool include
dictionary-encoded string columns only. The output contains a field "bitmapSerdeFactory" describing the type of bitmaps
used in the segment, and a field "bitmaps" containing the bitmaps for each value of each column. These are base64
encoded by default, but you can also dump them as lists of row numbers with `--decompress-bitmaps`.

Normally all columns are included, but if you like, you can limit the dump to specific columns with `--column name`.

Sample output:

```
{
  "bitmapSerdeFactory": {
    "type": "roaring",
    "compressRunOnSerialization": true
  },
  "bitmaps": {
    "isRobot": {
      "false": "//aExfu+Nv3X...",
      "true": "gAl7OoRByQ..."
    }
  }
}
```
