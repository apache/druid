This document describes the Druid security model that extensions use to enable user authentication and authorization services to Druid. 

## Authentication and authorization model

At the center of the Druid user authentication and authorization model are _resources_ and _actions_. A resource is something that authenticated users are trying to access or modify. An action is something that users are trying to do. 

There are three resource types:

* DATASOURCE &ndash; Each Druid table (i.e., `tables` in the `druid` schema in SQL) is a resource.
* CONFIG &ndash; Configuration resources exposed by the cluster components. 
* STATE &ndash; Cluster-wide state resources.

For specific resources associated with the types, see the endpoint list below and corresponding descriptions in [API Reference](./api-reference.md).

There are two actions:

* READ &ndash; Used for read-only operations.
* WRITE &ndash; Used for operations that are not read-only.

In practice, most deployments will only need to define two classes of users: 

* Admins, who have WRITE action permissions on all resource types. These users will add datasources and administer the system.  
* Data users, who only need READ access to DATASOURCE. These users should access Query APIs only through an API gateway. Other APIs and permissions include functionality that should be limited to server admins. 

It is important to note that WRITE access to DATASOURCE grants a user broad access. For instance, such users will have access to the Druid file system, S3 buckets, and credentials, among other things. As such, the ability to add and manage datasources should be allocated selectively to administrators.   


## Default user accounts

### Authenticator
If `druid.auth.authenticator.<authenticator-name>.initialAdminPassword` is set, a default admin user named "admin" will be created, with the specified initial password. If this configuration is omitted, the "admin" user will not be created.

If `druid.auth.authenticator.<authenticator-name>.initialInternalClientPassword` is set, a default internal system user named "druid_system" will be created, with the specified initial password. If this configuration is omitted, the "druid_system" user will not be created.


### Authorizer

Each Authorizer will always have a default "admin" and "druid_system" user with full privileges.

## Defining permissions

There are two action types in Druid: READ and WRITE

There are three resource types in Druid: DATASOURCE, CONFIG, and STATE.

### DATASOURCE
Resource names for this type are datasource names. Specifying a datasource permission allows the administrator to grant users access to specific datasources.

### CONFIG
There are two possible resource names for the "CONFIG" resource type, "CONFIG" and "security". Granting a user access to CONFIG resources allows them to access the following endpoints.

"CONFIG" resource name covers the following endpoints:

|Endpoint|Process Type|
|--------|---------|
|`/druid/coordinator/v1/config`|coordinator|
|`/druid/indexer/v1/worker`|overlord|
|`/druid/indexer/v1/worker/history`|overlord|
|`/druid/worker/v1/disable`|middleManager|
|`/druid/worker/v1/enable`|middleManager|

"security" resource name covers the following endpoint:

|Endpoint|Process Type|
|--------|---------|
|`/druid-ext/basic-security/authentication`|coordinator|
|`/druid-ext/basic-security/authorization`|coordinator|

### STATE
There is only one possible resource name for the "STATE" config resource type, "STATE". Granting a user access to STATE resources allows them to access the following endpoints.

"STATE" resource name covers the following endpoints:

|Endpoint|Process Type|
|--------|---------|
|`/druid/coordinator/v1`|coordinator|
|`/druid/coordinator/v1/rules`|coordinator|
|`/druid/coordinator/v1/rules/history`|coordinator|
|`/druid/coordinator/v1/servers`|coordinator|
|`/druid/coordinator/v1/tiers`|coordinator|
|`/druid/broker/v1`|broker|
|`/druid/v2/candidates`|broker|
|`/druid/indexer/v1/leader`|overlord|
|`/druid/indexer/v1/isLeader`|overlord|
|`/druid/indexer/v1/action`|overlord|
|`/druid/indexer/v1/workers`|overlord|
|`/druid/indexer/v1/scaling`|overlord|
|`/druid/worker/v1/enabled`|middleManager|
|`/druid/worker/v1/tasks`|middleManager|
|`/druid/worker/v1/task/{taskid}/shutdown`|middleManager|
|`/druid/worker/v1/task/{taskid}/log`|middleManager|
|`/druid/historical/v1`|historical|
|`/druid-internal/v1/segments/`|historical|
|`/druid-internal/v1/segments/`|peon|
|`/druid-internal/v1/segments/`|realtime|
|`/status`|all process types|

### HTTP methods

For information on what HTTP methods are supported on a particular request endpoint, please refer to the [API documentation](./api-reference.md).

GET requires READ permission, while POST and DELETE require WRITE permission.

### SQL Permissions

Queries on Druid datasources require DATASOURCE READ permissions for the specified datasource.

Queries on the [INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables](../querying/sql.md#information-schema) will
return information about datasources that the caller has DATASOURCE READ access to. Other
datasources will be omitted.

Queries on the [system schema tables](../querying/sql.md#system-schema) require the following permissions:
- `segments`: Segments will be filtered based on DATASOURCE READ permissions.
- `servers`: The user requires STATE READ permissions.
- `server_segments`: The user requires STATE READ permissions and segments will be filtered based on DATASOURCE READ permissions.
- `tasks`: Tasks will be filtered based on DATASOURCE READ permissions.

## Configuration Propagation

To prevent excessive load on the Coordinator, the Authenticator and Authorizer user/role Druid metadata store state is cached on each Druid process.

Each process will periodically poll the Coordinator for the latest Druid metadata store state, controlled by the `druid.auth.basic.common.pollingPeriod` and `druid.auth.basic.common.maxRandomDelay` properties.

When a configuration update occurs, the Coordinator can optionally notify each process with the updated Druid metadata store state. This behavior is controlled by the `enableCacheNotifications` and `cacheNotificationTimeout` properties on Authenticators and Authorizers.

Note that because of the caching, changes made to the user/role Druid metadata store may not be immediately reflected at each Druid process.
