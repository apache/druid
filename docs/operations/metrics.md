You can configure Druid to [emit metrics](../configuration/index.md#enabling-metrics) that are essential for monitoring query execution, ingestion, coordination, and so on.

All Druid metrics share a common set of fields:

* `timestamp` - the time the metric was created
* `metric` - the name of the metric
* `service` - the service name that emitted the metric
* `host` - the host name that emitted the metric
* `value` - some numeric value associated with the metric

Metrics may have additional dimensions beyond those listed above.

> Most metric values reset each emission period, as specified in `druid.monitoring.emissionPeriod`.

## Query metrics

|`query/bytes`|The total number of bytes returned to the requesting client in the query response from the broker.  Other services report the total bytes for their portion of the query. |Common: `dataSource`, `type`, `interval`, `hasFilters`, `duration`, `context`, `remoteAddress`, `id`. Aggregation Queries: `numMetrics`, `numComplexMetrics`. GroupBy: `numDimensions`. TopN: `threshold`, `dimension`.| |

If there are some segments moved after this snapshot is created, certain historicals and realtime tasks can report those segments as missing to the broker. The broker will re-send the query to the new servers that serve those segments after move. In this case, those segments can be counted more than once in this metric.|Varies.||

## Ingestion metrics

## General native ingestion metrics

|Metric|Description|Dimensions|Normal Value|
|------|-----------|----------|------------|
|`ingest/count`|Count of `1` every time an ingestion job runs (includes compaction jobs). Aggregate using dimensions. |dataSource, taskId, taskType, taskIngestionMode|Always `1`.|
|`ingest/segments/count`|Count of final segments created by job (includes tombstones). |dataSource, taskId, taskType, taskIngestionMode|At least `1`.|
|`ingest/tombstones/count`|Count of tombstones created by job |dataSource, taskId, taskType, taskIngestionMode|Zero or more for replace. Always zero for non-replace tasks (always zero for legacy replace, see below).|

The `taskIngestionMode` dimension includes the following modes: 
`APPEND`, `REPLACE_LEGACY`, and `REPLACE`. The `APPEND` mode indicates a native
ingestion job that is appending to existing segments; `REPLACE` a native ingestion
job replacing existing segments using tombstones; 
and `REPLACE_LEGACY` the original replace before tombstones.

The mode is decided using the values
of the `isAppendToExisting` and `isDropExisting` flags in the
task's `IOConfig` as follows:

|`isAppendToExisting` | `isDropExisting` | mode |
|---------------------|-------------------|------|
`true` | `false` | `APPEND`|
`true` | `true  ` | Invalid combination, exception thrown. |
`false` | `false` | `REPLACE_LEGACY` (this is the default for native batch ingestion). |
`false` | `true` | `REPLACE`|

Note that this metric is only emitted when `druid.coordinator.kill.audit.on` is set to true.| |Varies.|
|`metadata/kill/compaction/count`|Total number of compaction configurations that were automatically deleted from metadata store per each Coordinator kill compaction configuration duty run. Note that this metric is only emitted when `druid.coordinator.kill.compaction.on` is set to true.| |Varies.|
|`metadata/kill/rule/count`|Total number of rules that were automatically deleted from metadata store per each Coordinator kill rule duty run. This metric can help adjust `druid.coordinator.kill.rule.durationToRetain` configuration based on whether more or less rules need to be deleted per cycle. Note that this metric is only emitted when `druid.coordinator.kill.rule.on` is set to true.| |Varies.|
|`metadata/kill/datasource/count`|Total number of datasource metadata that were automatically deleted from metadata store per each Coordinator kill datasource duty run (Note: datasource metadata only exists for datasource created from supervisor). This metric can help adjust `druid.coordinator.kill.datasource.durationToRetain` configuration based on whether more or less datasource metadata need to be deleted per cycle. Note that this metric is only emitted when `druid.coordinator.kill.datasource.on` is set to true.| |Varies.|


If `emitBalancingStats` is set to `true` in the Coordinator [dynamic configuration](../configuration/index.md#dynamic-configuration), then [log entries](../configuration/logging.md) for class
`org.apache.druid.server.coordinator.duty.EmitClusterStatsAndMetrics` will have extra information on balancing
decisions.
