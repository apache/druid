Druid's core mechanism of supplying multiple related set of credentials/secrets/configurations via Druid extension mechanism. Currently, it is only supported for providing Kafka Consumer configuration in [Kafka Ingestion](../development/extensions-core/kafka-ingestion.md).

Eventually this will replace [PasswordProvider](./password-provider.md) 


Users can create custom extension of the `DynamicConfigProvider` interface that is registered at Druid process startup.

For more information, see [Adding a new DynamicConfigProvider implementation](../development/modules.md#adding-a-new-dynamicconfigprovider-implementation).
