Older versions of Apache Druid included a Select query type. Since Druid 0.17.0, it has been removed and replaced by the [Scan query](../querying/scan-query.md), which offers improved memory usage and performance. This solves issues that users had with Select queries causing Druid to run out of memory or slow down.
