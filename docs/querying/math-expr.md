 Apache Druid supports two query languages: [native queries](../querying/querying.md) and [Druid SQL](../querying/sql.md).
 This document describes the native language. For information about functions available in SQL, refer to the
 [SQL documentation](../querying/sql-scalar.md).
:::

Expressions are used in various places in the native query language, including
[virtual columns](../querying/virtual-columns.md) and [join conditions](../querying/datasource.md#join). They are
also generated by most [Druid SQL functions](../querying/sql-scalar.md) during the
[query translation](../querying/sql-translation.md) process.

Expressions are also used at ingestion time inside [transformations](../ingestion/ingestion-spec.md#transforms).

This expression language supports the following operators (listed in decreasing order of precedence).

|Operators|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|!, -|Unary NOT and Minus|
|^|Binary power op|
|*, /, %|Binary multiplicative|
|+, -|Binary additive|
|<, <=, >, >=, ==, !=|Binary Comparison|
|&&, &#124;&#124;|Binary Logical AND, OR|

Long, double, and string data types are supported. If a number contains a dot, it is interpreted as a double, otherwise it is interpreted as a long. That means, always add a '.' to your number if you want it interpreted as a double value. String literals should be quoted by single quotation marks.

Additionally, the expression language supports long, double, and string arrays. Array literals are created by wrapping square brackets around a list of scalar literals values delimited by a comma or space character. All values in an array literal must be the same type, however null values are accepted. Typed empty arrays may be defined by prefixing with their type in angle brackets: `<STRING>[]`, `<DOUBLE>[]`, or `<LONG>[]`.

Expressions can contain variables. Variable names may contain letters, digits, '\_' and '$'. Variable names must not begin with a digit. To escape other special characters, you can quote it with double quotation marks.

For logical operators, a number is true if and only if it is positive (0 or negative value means false). For string type, it's the evaluation result of 'Boolean.valueOf(string)'.

[Multi-value string dimensions](../querying/multi-value-dimensions.md) are supported and may be treated as either scalar or array typed values, as follows:  
* When treated as a scalar type, the expression is automatically transformed so that the scalar operation is applied across all values of the multi-valued type, mimicking Druid's native behavior. 
* Druid coerces values that result in arrays back into the native Druid string type for grouping and aggregation. Grouping on multi-value string dimensions in Druid groups by the individual values, not the 'array'. This behavior produces results similar to an implicit SQL `UNNEST` operation. Alternatively, you can use the `array_to_string` function to perform the aggregation on a _stringified_ version of the complete array and therefore preserve the complete row. To transform the stringified dimension back into the true native array type, use `string_to_array` in an expression post-aggregator.


The following built-in functions are available.

## General functions

If `chars` is an empty string, no padding is added, however `expr` may be trimmed if necessary.|
|rpad|rpad(expr, length, chars) returns a string of `length` from `expr` right-padded with `chars`. If `length` is shorter than the length of `expr`, the result is `expr` which is truncated to `length`. The result will be null if either `expr` or `chars` is null.

| string_to_array(str1,str2) | splits str1 into an array on the delimiter specified by str2, which is a regular expression |


## Apply functions
Apply functions allow for special 'lambda' expressions to be defined and applied to array inputs to enable free-form transformations.

| function | description |
| --- | --- |
| map(lambda,arr) | applies a transform specified by a single argument lambda expression to all elements of arr, returning a new array |
| cartesian_map(lambda,arr1,arr2,...) | applies a transform specified by a multi argument lambda expression to all elements of the Cartesian product of all input arrays, returning a new array; the number of lambda arguments and array inputs must be the same |

| fold(lambda,arr,acc) | folds a 2 argument lambda across arr using acc as the initial input value. The first argument of the lambda is the array element and the second the accumulator, returning a single accumulated value. |
| cartesian_fold(lambda,arr1,arr2,...,acc) | folds a multi argument lambda across the Cartesian product of all input arrays using acc as the initial input value. The first arguments of the lambda are the array elements of each array and the last is the accumulator, returning a single accumulated value. |
| any(lambda,arr) | returns 1 if any element in the array matches the lambda expression, else 0 |
| all(lambda,arr) | returns 1 if all elements in the array matches the lambda expression, else 0 |


### Lambda expressions syntax
Lambda expressions are a sort of function definition, where new identifiers can be defined and passed as input to the expression body
```
(identifier1 ...) -> expr
```
e.g.
```
(x, y) -> x + y 
```
The identifier arguments of a lambda expression correspond to the elements of the array it is being applied to. For example:
```
map((x) -> x + 1, some_multi_value_column)
```
will map each element of `some_multi_value_column` to the identifier `x` so that the lambda expression body can be evaluated for each `x`. The scoping rules are that lambda arguments will override identifiers which are defined externally from the lambda expression body. Using the same example:

```
map((x) -> x + 1, x)
```
in this case, the `x` when evaluating `x + 1` is the lambda argument, thus an element of the multi-valued column `x`, rather than the column `x` itself.


## JSON functions
JSON functions provide facilities to extract, transform, and create `COMPLEX<json>` values. 

| function | description |
|---|---|
| json_value(expr, path[, type]) | Extract a Druid literal (`STRING`, `LONG`, `DOUBLE`, `ARRAY<STRING>`, `ARRAY<LONG>`, or `ARRAY<DOUBLE>`) value from `expr` using JSONPath syntax of `path`. The optional `type` argument can be set to `'LONG'`,`'DOUBLE'`, `'STRING'`, `'ARRAY<LONG>'`, `'ARRAY<DOUBLE>'`, or `'ARRAY<STRING>'` to cast values to that type. |
| json_query(expr, path) | Extract a `COMPLEX<json>` value from `expr` using JSONPath syntax of `path` |
| json_query_array(expr, path) | Extract an `ARRAY<COMPLEX<json>>` value from `expr` using JSONPath syntax of `path`. If value is not an `ARRAY`, it gets translated into a single element `ARRAY` containing the value at `path`. The primary use of this function is to extract arrays of objects to use as inputs to other [array functions](#array-functions). |
| json_object(expr1, expr2[, expr3, expr4 ...]) | Construct a `COMPLEX<json>` with alternating 'key' and 'value' arguments|
| parse_json(expr) | Deserialize a JSON `STRING` into a `COMPLEX<json>`. If the input is not a `STRING` or it is invalid JSON, this function will result in an error.|
| try_parse_json(expr) | Deserialize a JSON `STRING` into a `COMPLEX<json>`. If the input is not a `STRING` or it is invalid JSON, this function will result in a `NULL` value. |
| to_json_string(expr) | Convert `expr` into a JSON `STRING` value |
| json_keys(expr, path) | Get array of field names from `expr` at the specified JSONPath `path`, or null if the data does not exist or have any fields |
| json_paths(expr) | Get array of all JSONPath paths available from `expr` |

### JSONPath syntax

Druid supports a small, simplified subset of the [JSONPath syntax](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath/blob/master/README.md) operators, primarily limited to extracting individual values from nested data structures.

|Operator|Description|
| --- | --- |
|`$`| Root element. All JSONPath expressions start with this operator. |
|`.<name>`| Child element in dot notation. |
|`['<name>']`| Child element in bracket notation. |
|`[<number>]`| Array index. |

See [SQL JSON documentation](../querying/sql-json-functions.md#jsonpath-syntax) for examples and [Nested columns](../querying/nested-columns.md) for more information on ingesting and storing nested data.

## Reduction functions

Reduction functions operate on zero or more expressions and return a single expression. If no expressions are passed as
arguments, then the result is `NULL`. The expressions must all be convertible to a common data type, which will be the
type of the result:
*  If all arguments are `NULL`, the result is `NULL`. Otherwise, `NULL` arguments are ignored.
*  If the arguments comprise a mix of numbers and strings, the arguments are interpreted as strings.
*  If all arguments are integer numbers, the arguments are interpreted as longs.
*  If all arguments are numbers and at least one argument is a double, the arguments are interpreted as doubles. 

| function | description |
| --- | --- |
| greatest([expr1, ...]) | Evaluates zero or more expressions and returns the maximum value based on comparisons as described above. |
| least([expr1, ...]) | Evaluates zero or more expressions and returns the minimum value based on comparisons as described above. |


## IP address functions

For the IPv4 address functions, the `address` argument accepts either an IPv4 dotted-decimal string (e.g. "192.168.0.1") or an IP address represented as a long (e.g. 3232235521). Format the `subnet` argument as an IPv4 address subnet in CIDR notation (e.g. "192.168.0.0/16").

For the IPv6 address function, the `address` argument accepts a semicolon separated string (e.g. "75e9:efa4:29c6:85f6::232c"). The format of the `subnet` argument should be an IPv6 address subnet in CIDR notation (e.g. "75e9:efa4:29c6:85f6::/64").

| function | description |
| --- | --- |
| ipv4_match(address, subnet) | Returns 1 if the IPv4 `address` belongs to the `subnet` literal, else 0. If `address` is not a valid IPv4 address, then 0 is returned. This function is more efficient if `address` is a long instead of a string.|
| ipv4_parse(address) | Parses `address` into an IPv4 address stored as a long. Returns `address` if it is already a valid IPv4 integer address.  Returns null if `address` cannot be represented as an IPv4 address. |
| ipv4_stringify(address) | Converts `address` into an IPv4 address dotted-decimal string. Returns `address` if it is already a valid IPv4 dotted-decimal string. Returns null if `address` cannot be represented as an IPv4 address.|
| ipv6_match(address, subnet) | Returns 1 if the IPv6 `address` belongs to the `subnet` literal, else 0. If `address` is not a valid IPv6 address, then 0 is returned.|

## Other functions

| function | description |
| --- | --- |
| human_readable_binary_byte_format(value[, precision]) | Format a number in human-readable [IEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix) format. `precision` must be in the range of [0,3] (default: 2). For example:<li> human_readable_binary_byte_format(1048576) returns `1.00 MiB`</li><li>human_readable_binary_byte_format(1048576, 3) returns `1.000 MiB`</li> |
| human_readable_decimal_byte_format(value[, precision]) | Format a number in human-readable [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix) format. `precision` must be in the range of [0,3] (default: 2). For example:<li> human_readable_decimal_byte_format(1000000) returns `1.00 MB`</li><li>human_readable_decimal_byte_format(1000000, 3) returns `1.000 MB`</li> |
| human_readable_decimal_format(value[, precision]) | Format a number in human-readable SI format. `precision` must be in the range of [0,3] (default: 2). For example:<li>human_readable_decimal_format(1000000) returns `1.00 M`</li><li>human_readable_decimal_format(1000000, 3) returns `1.000 M`</li>  |

* conditional functions: `nvl` is supported for string and numeric types
* string functions: the concatenation operator (`+`) and `concat` function are supported for string and numeric types
* other: `parse_long` is supported for numeric and string types

## Logical operator modes
In Druid 28.0 and later, `druid.expressions.useStrictBooleans=true` is set by default. Logical operations treat `null` values as "unknown" for SQL compatible behavior. _All boolean output functions_ will output 'homogeneous' `LONG` typed boolean values of `1` for `true` and `0` for `false`. 

For the "or" operator:
* `true || null`, `null || true`, -> `1`
* `false || null`, `null || false`, `null || null`-> `null`

For the "and" operator:
* `true && null`, `null && true`, `null && null` -> `null`
* `false && null`, `null && false` -> `0`

Druid currently still retains implicit conversion of `LONG`, `DOUBLE`, and `STRING` types into boolean values in both modes: 
* `LONG` or `DOUBLE`: any value greater than 0 is considered `true`, else `false`.
* `STRING`: the value `'true'` (case insensitive) is considered `true`, everything else is `false`.

SQL compatible behavior:
* `100 && 11` -> `1`
* `0.7 || 0.3` -> `1`
* `100 && 0` -> `0`
* `'troo' && 'true'` -> `0`
* `'troo' || 'true'` -> `1`

Prior to Druid 28.0.0, `druid.expressions.useStrictBooleans=false` was the default. In this mode, boolean function expressions have inconsistent handling of true and false values. The logical 'and' and 'or' operators behave in a manner that is incompatible with SQL, even if SQL compatible null handling mode (`druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=false`) is enabled. Logical operators also pass through their input values, similar to many scripting languages, and treat `null` as false, which results in some rather strange behavior. Other boolean operations, such as comparisons and equality, retain their input types (e.g. `DOUBLE` comparison produces `1.0` for true and `0.0` for false), while many other boolean functions strictly produce `LONG` typed values of `1` for true and `0` for false. This legacy mode can still be enabled by setting `druid.expressions.useStrictBooleans=false`.

Legacy behavior:
* `100 && 11` -> `11`
* `0.7 || 0.3` -> `0.3`
* `100 && 0` -> `0`
* `'troo' && 'true'` -> `'troo'`
* `'troo' || 'true'` -> `'true'`
