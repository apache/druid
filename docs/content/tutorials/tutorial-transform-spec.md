# Tutorial: Transforming input data

This tutorial will demonstrate how to use transform specs to filter and transform input data during ingestion.

For this tutorial, we'll assume you've already downloaded Druid as described in 
the [single-machine quickstart](index.html) and have it running on your local machine.

It will also be helpful to have finished [Tutorial: Loading a file](/docs/VERSION/tutorials/tutorial-batch.html) and [Tutorial: Querying data](/docs/VERSION/tutorials/tutorial-query.html).

## Sample data

## Load data with transform specs

## Query the transformed data
