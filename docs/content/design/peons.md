Peons
-----

For Peon Configuration, see [Peon Configuration](../configuration/indexing-service.html).

Peons run a single task in a single JVM. MiddleManager is responsible for creating Peons for running tasks.
Peons should rarely (if ever for testing purposes) be run on their own.

Running
-------

The peon should very rarely ever be run independent of the middle manager unless for development purposes.

```
io.druid.cli.Main internal peon <task_file> <status_file>
```

The task file contains the task JSON object.
The status file indicates where the task status will be output.
