# Getting Started with Apache Druid (incubating)

## Overview

If you are new to Druid, we recommend reading the [Design Overview](../design/index.html) and the [Ingestion Overview](../ingestion/index.html) first for a basic understanding of Druid.

## Single-server Quickstart and Tutorials

To get started with running Druid, the simplest and quickest way is to try the [single-server quickstart and tutorials](../tutorials/index.html).

## Deploying a Druid cluster

If you wish to jump straight to deploying Druid as a cluster, or if you have an existing single-server deployment that you wish to migrate to a clustered deployment, please see the [Clustered Deployment Guide](../tutorials/cluster.md).

## Operating Druid

The [Configuration Reference](../configuration/index.html) describes all of Druid's configuration properties.

The [API Reference](../operations/api-reference.html) describes the APIs available on each Druid process.

The [Basic Cluster Tuning Guide](../operations/basic-cluster-tuning.html) is an introductory guide for tuning your Druid cluster.
