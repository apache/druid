# Batch Data Ingestion

Druid can load data from static files through a variety of methods described here.

## Native Batch Ingestion

Druid has built-in batch ingestion functionality. See [here](../ingestion/native_tasks.html) for more info.

## Hadoop Batch Ingestion

Hadoop can be used for batch ingestion. The Hadoop-based batch ingestion will be faster and more scalable than the native batch ingestion. See [here](../ingestion/hadoop.html) for more details.

Having Problems?
----------------
Getting data into Druid can definitely be difficult for first time users. Please don't hesitate to ask questions in our IRC channel or on our [google groups page](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/druid-user).
