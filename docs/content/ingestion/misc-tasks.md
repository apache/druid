# Miscellaneous Tasks

## Noop Task

These tasks start, sleep for a time and are used only for testing. The available grammar is:

```json
{
    "type": "noop",
    "id": <optional_task_id>,
    "interval" : <optional_segment_interval>,
    "runTime" : <optional_millis_to_sleep>,
    "firehose": <optional_firehose_to_test_connect>
}
```


## Segment Merging Tasks (Deprecated)

### Append Task

Append tasks append a list of segments together into a single segment (one after the other). The grammar is:

```json
{
    "type": "append",
    "id": <task_id>,
    "dataSource": <task_datasource>,
    "segments": <JSON list of DataSegment objects to append>,
    "aggregations": <optional list of aggregators>,
    "context": <task context>
}
```

### Merge Task

Merge tasks merge a list of segments together. Any common timestamps are merged.
If rollup is disabled as part of ingestion, common timestamps are not merged and rows are reordered by their timestamp.

The grammar is:

```json
{
    "type": "merge",
    "id": <task_id>,
    "dataSource": <task_datasource>,
    "aggregations": <list of aggregators>,
    "rollup": <whether or not to rollup data during a merge>,
    "segments": <JSON list of DataSegment objects to merge>,
    "context": <task context>
}
```

### Same Interval Merge Task

Same Interval Merge task is a shortcut of merge task, all segments in the interval are going to be merged.

The grammar is:

```json
{
    "type": "same_interval_merge",
    "id": <task_id>,
    "dataSource": <task_datasource>,
    "aggregations": <list of aggregators>,
    "rollup": <whether or not to rollup data during a merge>,
    "interval": <DataSegment objects in this interval are going to be merged>,
    "context": <task context>
}
```
