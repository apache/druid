# Druid Firehoses
Firehoses describe the data stream source. They are pluggable and thus the configuration schema can and will vary based on the `type` of the firehose.

| Field | Type | Description | Required |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|
| type | String | Specifies the type of firehose. Each value will have its own configuration schema, firehoses packaged with Druid are described below. | yes |

We describe the configuration of the [Kafka firehose example](../ingestion/stream-pull.html#realtime-specfile), but there are other types available in Druid (see below).

-   `consumerProps` is a map of properties for the Kafka consumer. The JSON object is converted into a Properties object and passed along to the Kafka consumer.
-   `feed` is the feed that the Kafka consumer should read from.

Available Firehoses
-------------------

There are several firehoses readily available in Druid, some are meant for examples, others can be used directly in a production environment.

#### KafkaEightFirehose

Please note that the [druid-kafka-eight module](../operations/including-extensions.html) is required for this firehose. This firehose acts as a Kafka 0.8.x consumer and ingests data from Kafka.

Sample spec:

```json
"firehose": {
  "type": "kafka-0.8",
  "consumerProps": {
    "zookeeper.connect": "localhost:2181",
    "zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms" : "15000",
    "zookeeper.session.timeout.ms" : "15000",
    "zookeeper.sync.time.ms" : "5000",
    "group.id": "druid-example",
    "fetch.message.max.bytes" : "1048586",
    "auto.offset.reset": "largest",
    "auto.commit.enable": "false"
  },
  "feed": "wikipedia"
}
```

|property|description|required?|
|--------|-----------|---------|
|type|This should be "kafka-0.8"|yes|
|consumerProps|The full list of consumer configs can be [here](https://kafka.apache.org/08/configuration.html).|yes|
|feed|Kafka maintains feeds of messages in categories called topics. This is the topic name.|yes|

#### StaticS3Firehose

This firehose ingests events from a predefined list of S3 objects.

Sample spec:

```json
"firehose" : {
    "type" : "static-s3",
    "uris": ["s3://foo/bar/file.gz", "s3://bar/foo/file2.gz"]
}
```

|property|description|default|required?|
|--------|-----------|-------|---------|
|type|This should be "static-s3"|N/A|yes|
|uris|JSON array of URIs where s3 files to be ingested are located.|N/A|yes|

#### StaticAzureBlobStoreFirehose

This firehose ingests events, similar to the StaticS3Firehose, but from an Azure Blob Store.

Data is newline delimited, with one JSON object per line and parsed as per the `InputRowParser` configuration.

The storage account is shared with the one used for Azure deep storage functionality, but blobs can be in a different container.

As with the S3 blobstore, it is assumed to be gzipped if the extension ends in .gz

Sample spec:

```json
"firehose" : {
    "type" : "static-azure-blobstore",
    "blobs": [
        {
          "container": "container",
          "path": "/path/to/your/file.json"
        },
        {
          "container": "anothercontainer",
          "path": "/another/path.json"
        }
    ]
}
```

|property|description|default|required?|
|--------|-----------|-------|---------|
|type|This should be "static-azure-blobstore".|N/A|yes|
|blobs|JSON array of [Azure blobs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/ee691964.aspx).|N/A|yes|

Azure Blobs:

|property|description|default|required?|

|container|Name of the azure [container](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-blobs/#create-a-container)|N/A|yes|
|path|The path where data is located.|N/A|yes|

#### TwitterSpritzerFirehose

This firehose connects directly to the twitter spritzer data stream.

Sample spec:

```json
"firehose" : {
    "type" : "twitzer",
    "maxEventCount": -1,
    "maxRunMinutes": 0
}
```

|property|description|default|required?|
|--------|-----------|-------|---------|
|type|This should be "twitzer"|N/A|yes|
|maxEventCount|max events to receive, -1 is infinite, 0 means nothing is delivered; use this to prevent infinite space consumption or to prevent getting throttled at an inconvenient time.|N/A|yes|
|maxRunMinutes|maximum number of minutes to fetch Twitter events.  Use this to prevent getting throttled at an inconvenient time. If zero or less, no time limit for run.|N/A|yes|

#### RabbitMQFirehose

This firehose ingests events from a define rabbit-mq queue.

**Note:** Add **amqp-client-3.2.1.jar** to lib directory of druid to use this firehose.

A sample spec for rabbitmq firehose:

```json
"firehose" : {
   "type" : "rabbitmq",
   "connection" : {
     "host": "localhost",
     "port": "5672",
