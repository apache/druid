This expression language supports the following operators (listed in decreasing order of precedence).

|Operators|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|!, -|Unary NOT and Minus|
|^|Binary power op|
|*, /, %|Binary multiplicative|
|+, -|Binary additive|
|<, <=, >, >=, ==, !=|Binary Comparison|
|&&,\|\||Binary Logical AND, OR|

Long, double and string data types are supported. If a number contains a dot, it is interpreted as a double, otherwise it is interpreted as a long. That means, always add a '.' to your number if you want it interpreted as a double value. String literal should be quoted by single quotation marks.

Expressions can contain variables. Variable names may contain letters, digits, '\_' and '$'. Variable names must not begin with a digit. To escape other special characters, user can quote it with double quotation marks.

For logical operators, a number is true if and only if it is positive (0 or minus value means false). For string type, it's evaluation result of 'Boolean.valueOf(string)'.

Also, the following built-in functions are supported.

|name|description|
|----|-----------|
|cast|cast(expr,'LONG' or 'DOUBLE' or 'STRING') returns expr with specified type. exception can be thrown |
|if|if(predicate,then,else) returns 'then' if 'predicate' evaluates to a positive number, otherwise it returns 'else' |
|nvl|nvl(expr,expr-for-null) returns 'expr-for-null' if 'expr' is null (or empty string for string type) |
|timestamp|timestamp(expr[,format-string]) parses string expr into date then returns milli-seconds from java epoch. without 'format-string' it's regarded as ISO datetime format |
|unix_timestamp|same with 'timestamp' function but returns seconds instead |

And built-in math functions. See javadoc of java.lang.Math for detailed explanation for each function.
