# Druid Metrics

Druid emits a variety of query, ingestion, and coordination metrics.

Metrics can be displayed in the runtime log file or over http (to a service such as Apache Kafka). Metric emission is disabled by default.

Please refer to the following [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15XxGrGv2ggdt4SnCoIsckqUNJBZ9ludyhC9hNQa3l-M/edit#gid=0) for available Druid metrics. In the near future, we will be reworking Druid metrics and fully listing out important metrics to monitor and their expected values.
