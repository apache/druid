# Apache Cassandra

To use this extension, make sure to [include](../../operations/including-extensions.html) `druid-cassandra-storage` extension.

[Apache Cassandra](http://www.datastax.com/what-we-offer/products-services/datastax-enterprise/apache-cassandra) can also 
be leveraged for deep storage.  This requires some additional druid configuration as well as setting up the necessary 
schema within a Cassandra keystore.
