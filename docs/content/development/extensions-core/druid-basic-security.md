# Druid Basic Security

This extension adds:
- an Authenticator which supports [HTTP Basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
- an Authorizer which implements basic role-based access control

Make sure to [include](../../operations/including-extensions.html) `druid-basic-security` as an extension.

Please see [Authentication and Authorization](../../design/auth.html) for more information on the extension interfaces being implemented.

## Configuration

The examples in the section will use "MyBasicAuthenticator" and "MyBasicAuthorizer" as names for the Authenticator and Authorizer.

These properties are not tied to specific Authenticator or Authorizer instances.

These configuration properties should be added to the common runtime properties file.

### Properties
|Property|Description|Default|required|
|--------|-----------|-------|--------|
|`druid.auth.basic.common.pollingPeriod`|Defines in milliseconds how often nodes should poll the Coordinator for the current authenticator/authorizer database state.|60000|No|
|`druid.auth.basic.common.maxRandomDelay`|Defines in milliseconds the amount of random delay to add to the pollingPeriod, to spread polling requests across time.|6000|No|
|`druid.auth.basic.common.maxSyncRetries`|Determines how many times a service will retry if the authentication/authorization database state sync with the Coordinator fails.|10|No|
|`druid.auth.basic.common.cacheDirectory`|If defined, snapshots of the basic Authenticator and Authorizer database caches will be stored on disk in this directory. If this property is defined, when a service is starting, it will attempt to initialize its caches from these on-disk snapshots, if the service is unable to initialize its state by communicating with the Coordinator.|null|No|


### Creating an Authenticator
```
druid.auth.authenticatorChain=["MyBasicAuthenticator"]

druid.auth.authenticator.MyBasicAuthenticator.type=basic
druid.auth.authenticator.MyBasicAuthenticator.initialAdminPassword=password1
druid.auth.authenticator.MyBasicAuthenticator.initialInternalClientPassword=password2
druid.auth.authenticator.MyBasicAuthenticator.authorizerName=MyBasicAuthorizer
```

To use the Basic authenticator, add an authenticator with type `basic` to the authenticatorChain.

Configuration of the named authenticator is assigned through properties with the form:

```
druid.auth.authenticator.<authenticatorName>.<authenticatorProperty>
```

The configuration examples in the rest of this document will use "MyBasicAuthenticator" as the name of the authenticator being configured.


#### Properties
|Property|Description|Default|required|
|--------|-----------|-------|--------|
|`druid.auth.authenticator.MyBasicAuthenticator.initialAdminPassword`|Initial [Password Provider](../../operations/password-provider.html) for the automatically created default admin user. If no password is specified, the default admin user will not be created. If the default admin user already exists, setting this property will not affect its password.|null|No|
|`druid.auth.authenticator.MyBasicAuthenticator.initialInternalClientPassword`|Initial [Password Provider](../../operations/password-provider.html) for the default internal system user, used for internal node communication. If no password is specified, the default internal system user will not be created. If the default internal system user already exists, setting this property will not affect its password.|null|No|
|`druid.auth.authenticator.MyBasicAuthenticator.enableCacheNotifications`|If true, the Coordinator will notify Druid nodes whenever a configuration change to this Authenticator occurs, allowing them to immediately update their state without waiting for polling.|true|No|
|`druid.auth.authenticator.MyBasicAuthenticator.cacheNotificationTimeout`|The timeout in milliseconds for the cache notifications.|5000|No|
|`druid.auth.authenticator.MyBasicAuthenticator.credentialIterations`|Number of iterations to use for password hashing.|10000|No|
|`druid.auth.authenticator.MyBasicAuthenticator.authorizerName`|Authorizer that requests should be directed to|N/A|Yes|

### Creating an Escalator

```
# Escalator
druid.escalator.type=basic
druid.escalator.internalClientUsername=druid_system
druid.escalator.internalClientPassword=password2
druid.escalator.authorizerName=MyBasicAuthorizer
```

#### Properties
|Property|Description|Default|required|
|--------|-----------|-------|--------|
|`druid.escalator.internalClientUsername`|The escalator will use this username for requests made as the internal systerm user.|n/a|Yes|
|`druid.escalator.internalClientPassword`|The escalator will use this [Password Provider](../../operations/password-provider.html) for requests made as the internal system user.|n/a|Yes|
|`druid.escalator.authorizerName`|Authorizer that requests should be directed to.|n/a|Yes|


### Creating an Authorizer
```
druid.auth.authorizers=["MyBasicAuthorizer"]

druid.auth.authorizer.MyBasicAuthorizer.type=basic
```

To use the Basic authorizer, add an authenticator with type `basic` to the authorizers list.

Configuration of the named authenticator is assigned through properties with the form:

```
druid.auth.authorizer.<authorizerName>.<authorizerProperty>
```

#### Properties
|Property|Description|Default|required|
|--------|-----------|-------|--------|
|`druid.auth.authorizer.MyBasicAuthorizer.enableCacheNotifications`|If true, the Coordinator will notify Druid nodes whenever a configuration change to this Authorizer occurs, allowing them to immediately update their state without waiting for polling.|true|No|
|`druid.auth.authorizer.MyBasicAuthorizer.cacheNotificationTimeout`|The timeout in milliseconds for the cache notifications.|5000|No|

},
{
  "resource": {
    "name": "wikiticker",
    "type": "DATASOURCE"
  },
  "action": "WRITE"

]
```

The "name" field for resources in the permission definitions are regexes used to match resource names during authorization checks.

Please see [Defining permissions](#defining-permissions) for more details.

##### Cache Load Status
`GET(/druid-ext/basic-security/authorization/loadStatus)`
Return the current load status of the local caches of the authorization database.

## Default user accounts

### Authenticator
If `druid.auth.authenticator.<authenticator-name>.initialAdminPassword` is set, a default admin user named "admin" will be created, with the specified initial password. If this configuration is omitted, the "admin" user will not be created.

If `druid.auth.authenticator.<authenticator-name>.initialInternalClientPassword` is set, a default internal system user named "druid_system" will be created, with the specified initial password. If this configuration is omitted, the "druid_system" user will not be created.


### Authorizer

Each Authorizer will always have a default "admin" and "druid_system" user with full privileges.

## Defining permissions

There are two action types in Druid: READ and WRITE

There are three resource types in Druid: DATASOURCE, CONFIG, and STATE.

### DATASOURCE
Resource names for this type are datasource names. Specifying a datasource permission allows the administrator to grant users access to specific datasources.

### CONFIG
There are two possible resource names for the "CONFIG" resource type, "CONFIG" and "security". Granting a user access to CONFIG resources allows them to access the following endpoints.

"CONFIG" resource name covers the following endpoints:

|Endpoint|Node Type|
|--------|---------|
|`/druid/coordinator/v1/config`|coordinator|
|`/druid/indexer/v1/worker`|overlord|
|`/druid/indexer/v1/worker/history`|overlord|
|`/druid/worker/v1/disable`|middleManager|
|`/druid/worker/v1/enable`|middleManager|

"security" resource name covers the following endpoint:

|Endpoint|Node Type|
|--------|---------|
|`/druid-ext/basic-security/authentication`|coordinator|
|`/druid-ext/basic-security/authorization`|coordinator|

### STATE
There is only one possible resource name for the "STATE" config resource type, "STATE". Granting a user access to STATE resources allows them to access the following endpoints.

"STATE" resource name covers the following endpoints:

|Endpoint|Node Type|
|--------|---------|
|`/druid/coordinator/v1`|coordinator|
|`/druid/coordinator/v1/rules`|coordinator|
|`/druid/coordinator/v1/rules/history`|coordinator|
|`/druid/coordinator/v1/servers`|coordinator|
|`/druid/coordinator/v1/tiers`|coordinator|
|`/druid/broker/v1`|broker|
|`/druid/v2/candidates`|broker|
|`/druid/indexer/v1/leader`|overlord|
|`/druid/indexer/v1/isLeader`|overlord|
|`/druid/indexer/v1/action`|overlord|
|`/druid/indexer/v1/workers`|overlord|
|`/druid/indexer/v1/scaling`|overlord|
|`/druid/worker/v1/enabled`|middleManager|
|`/druid/worker/v1/tasks`|middleManager|
|`/druid/worker/v1/task/{taskid}/shutdown`|middleManager|
|`/druid/worker/v1/task/{taskid}/log`|middleManager|
|`/druid/historical/v1`|historical|
|`/druid-internal/v1/segments/`|historical|
|`/druid-internal/v1/segments/`|peon|
|`/druid-internal/v1/segments/`|realtime|
|`/status`|all process types|

### HTTP methods

For information on what HTTP methods are supported on a particular request endpoint, please refer to the [API documentation](../../operations/api-reference.html).

GET requires READ permission, while POST and DELETE require WRITE permission.

## Configuration Propagation

To prevent excessive load on the Coordinator, the Authenticator and Authorizer user/role database state is cached on each Druid node.

Each node will periodically poll the Coordinator for the latest database state, controlled by the `druid.auth.basic.common.pollingPeriod` and `druid.auth.basic.common.maxRandomDelay` properties.

When a configuration update occurs, the Coordinator can optionally notify each node with the updated database state. This behavior is controlled by the `enableCacheNotifications` and `cacheNotificationTimeout` properties on Authenticators and Authorizers.

Note that because of the caching, changes made to the user/role database may not be immediately reflected at each Druid node.
