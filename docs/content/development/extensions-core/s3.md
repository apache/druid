# S3-compatible

Make sure to [include](../../operations/including-extensions.html) `druid-s3-extensions` as an extension.

## Deep Storage

S3-compatible deep storage means either AWS S3 or a compatible service like Google Storage which exposes the same API as S3.

### Configuration

The AWS SDK requires that the target region be specified. Two ways of doing this are by using the JVM system property `aws.region` or the environment variable `AWS_REGION`.

As an example, to set the region to 'us-east-1' through system properties:

- Add `-Daws.region=us-east-1` to the jvm.config file for all Druid services.
- Add `-Daws.region=us-east-1` to `druid.indexer.runner.javaOpts` in middleManager/runtime.properties so that the property will be passed to Peon (worker) processes.

|Property|Description|Default|
|--------|-----------|-------|
|`druid.s3.accessKey`|S3 access key.|Must be set.|
|`druid.s3.secretKey`|S3 secret key.|Must be set.|
|`druid.storage.bucket`|Bucket to store in.|Must be set.|
|`druid.storage.baseKey`|Base key prefix to use, i.e. what directory.|Must be set.|
|`druid.storage.sse.type`|Server-side encryption type. Should be one of `s3`, `kms`, and `custom`. See the below [Server-side encryption section](#server-side-encryption) for more details.|None|
|`druid.storage.sse.kms.keyId`|AWS KMS key ID. Can be empty if `druid.storage.sse.type` is `kms`.|None|
|`druid.storage.sse.custom.base64EncodedKey`|Base64-encoded key. Should be specified if `druid.storage.sse.type` is `custom`.|None|
|`druid.s3.protocol`|Communication protocol type to use when sending requests to AWS. `http` or `https` can be used.|`https`|
|`druid.s3.disableChunkedEncoding`|Disables chunked encoding. See [AWS document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/AmazonS3Builder.html#disableChunkedEncoding--) for details.|false|
|`druid.s3.enablePathStyleAccess`|Enables path style access. See [AWS document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/AmazonS3Builder.html#enablePathStyleAccess--) for details.|false|
|`druid.s3.forceGlobalBucketAccessEnabled`|Enables global bucket access. See [AWS document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/AmazonS3Builder.html#setForceGlobalBucketAccessEnabled-java.lang.Boolean-) for details.|false|
|`druid.s3.endpoint.url`|Service endpoint either with or without the protocol.|None|
|`druid.s3.endpoint.signingRegion`|Region to use for SigV4 signing of requests (e.g. us-west-1).|None|
|`druid.s3.proxy.host`|Proxy host to connect through.|None|
|`druid.s3.proxy.port`|Port on the proxy host to connect through.|None|
|`druid.s3.proxy.username`|User name to use when connecting through a proxy.|None|
|`druid.s3.proxy.password`|Password to use when connecting through a proxy.|None|

## Server-side encryption

You can enable [server-side encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/serv-side-encryption.html) by setting
`druid.storage.sse.type` to a supported type of server-side encryption. The current supported types are:

- s3: [Server-side encryption with S3-managed encryption keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html)
- kms: [Server-side encryption with AWS KMSâ€“Managed Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html)
- custom: [Server-side encryption with Customer-Provided Encryption Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html)

## StaticS3Firehose

This firehose ingests events from a predefined list of S3 objects.
This firehose is _splittable_ and can be used by [native parallel index tasks](../../ingestion/native_tasks.html#parallel-index-task).
Since each split represents an object in this firehose, each worker task of `index_parallel` will read an object.

Sample spec:

```json
"firehose" : {
    "type" : "static-s3",
    "uris": ["s3://foo/bar/file.gz", "s3://bar/foo/file2.gz"]
}
```

This firehose provides caching and prefetching features. In IndexTask, a firehose can be read twice if intervals or
shardSpecs are not specified, and, in this case, caching can be useful. Prefetching is preferred when direct scan of objects is slow.

|property|description|default|required?|
|--------|-----------|-------|---------|
|type|This should be `static-s3`.|N/A|yes|
|uris|JSON array of URIs where s3 files to be ingested are located.|N/A|`uris` or `prefixes` must be set|
|prefixes|JSON array of URI prefixes for the locations of s3 files to be ingested.|N/A|`uris` or `prefixes` must be set|
|maxCacheCapacityBytes|Maximum size of the cache space in bytes. 0 means disabling cache. Cached files are not removed until the ingestion task completes.|1073741824|no|
|maxFetchCapacityBytes|Maximum size of the fetch space in bytes. 0 means disabling prefetch. Prefetched files are removed immediately once they are read.|1073741824|no|
|prefetchTriggerBytes|Threshold to trigger prefetching s3 objects.|maxFetchCapacityBytes / 2|no|
|fetchTimeout|Timeout for fetching an s3 object.|60000|no|
|maxFetchRetry|Maximum retry for fetching an s3 object.|3|no|
