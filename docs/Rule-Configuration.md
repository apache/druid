Note: It is recommended that the master console is used to configure rules. However, the master node does have HTTP endpoints to programmatically configure rules.

Load Rules
----------

Load rules indicate how many replicants of a segment should exist in a server tier.

### Interval Load Rule

Interval load rules are of the form:

    <code>
    {
      "type" : "loadByInterval",
      "interval" : "2012-01-01/2013-01-01",
      "tier" : "hot"
    }
    </code>

type - this should always be “loadByInterval”
interval - A JSON Object representing ISO-8601 Intervals
tier - the configured compute node tier

### Period Load Rule

Period load rules are of the form:

    <code>
    {
      "type" : "loadByInterval",
      "period" : "P1M",
      "tier" : "hot"
    }
    </code>

type - this should always be “loadByPeriod”
period - A JSON Object representing ISO-8601 Periods
tier - the configured compute node tier

The interval of a segment will be compared against the specified period. The rule matches if the period overlaps the interval.

Drop Rules
----------

Drop rules indicate when segments should be dropped from the cluster.

### Interval Drop Rule

Interval drop rules are of the form:

    <code>
    {
      "type" : "dropByInterval",
      "interval" : "2012-01-01/2013-01-01"
    }
    </code>

type - this should always be “dropByInterval”
interval - A JSON Object representing ISO-8601 Periods

A segment is dropped if the interval contains the interval of the segment.

### Period Drop Rule

Period drop rules are of the form:

    <code>
    {
      "type" : "dropByPeriod",
      "period" : "P1M"
    }
    </code>

type - this should always be “dropByPeriod”
period - A JSON Object representing ISO-8601 Periods

The interval of a segment will be compared against the specified period. The period is from some time in the past to the current time. The rule matches if the period contains the interval.
