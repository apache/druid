/**
 * This is an interface that holds onto the stream of incoming data.  Realtime data ingestion is built around this
 * abstraction.  In order to add a new type of source for realtime data ingestion, all you need to do is implement
 * one of these and register it with the Main.
 *
 * In contrast to Firehose v1 version, FirehoseV2 will always operate in a "peek, then advance" manner.
 * And the intended usage patttern is
 * 1. Call start()
 * 2. Read currRow()
 * 3. Call advance()
 * 4. If index should be committed: commit()
 * 5. GOTO 2
 *
 * Note that commit() is being called *after* advance.
 * 
 * This object acts a lot like an Iterator, but it doesn't extend the Iterator interface because it extends
 * Closeable and it is very important that the close() method doesn't get forgotten, which is easy to do if this
 * gets passed around as an Iterator.
 * <p>
 * The implementation of this interface only needs to be minimally thread-safe. The methods ##start(), ##advance(),
 * ##currRow() and ##makeCommitter() are all called from the same thread.  ##makeCommitter(), however, returns a callback
 * which will be called on another thread, so the operations inside of that callback must be thread-safe.
 * </p>

     * This method is called when the main processing loop starts to persist its current batch of things to process.
     * The returned committer will be run when the current batch has been successfully persisted
     * and the metadata the committer carries can also be persisted along with segment data. There is usually
     * some time lag between when this method is called and when the runnable is run.  The Runnable is also run on
     * a separate thread so its operation should be thread-safe.
     * 
     * Note that "correct" usage of this interface will always call advance() before commit() if the current row
     * is considered in the commit.
     *
     * The Runnable is essentially just a lambda/closure that is run() after data supplied by this instance has
     * been committed on the writer side of this interface protocol.
     * <p>
     * A simple implementation of this interface might do nothing when run() is called,
     * and save proper commit information in metadata
