/**
 * Registry of the table types supported in the catalog. This registry
 * is used to validate insertions and updates. A table spec has a type field.
 * That spec is said to be "resolved" when we use that type field to look up
 * the definition for that type, and combine them into a {@link ResolvedTable}.
 * <p>
 * Note an inherent race condition:
 * once a record is written into the metadata DB, that record has a life
 * independent of what happens in this table. It may be that a catalog entry
 * is created for a table type defined in an extension. Later, that extension
 * is removed. The system must still work with the now "unknown" table types
 * in the DB. But, we won't allow the use of, changes to, or new instances of
 * that type. The choice is to delete the now undefined table, or restore the
 * extension.
 * <p>
 * Holds onto the JSON mapper to simplify the resolution process: the
 * {@link ResolvedTable} provides the mapper used to serialize the table spec.
