/**
 * This interface defines entities that create and manage potentially multiple {@link Appenderator} instances.
 *
 * The AppenderatorsManager should be used by tasks running in a Peon or an CliIndexer process when it needs
 * an Appenderator.
 *
 * The AppenderatorsManager also provides methods for creating {@link QueryRunner} instances that read the data
 * held by the Appenderators created through the AppenderatorsManager.
 *
 * In later updates, this interface will be used to manage memory usage across multiple Appenderators,
 * useful for the Indexer where all Tasks run in the same process.
 *
 * The methods on AppenderatorsManager can be called by multiple threads.
 *
 * This class provides similar functionality to the {@link org.apache.druid.server.coordination.ServerManager} and
 * {@link org.apache.druid.server.SegmentManager} on the Historical processes.
