## Java 11

From the root of the repo, run `docker build -t apache/druid:tag -f distribution/docker/Dockerfile.java11 .` which will build Druid to run in a Java 11 environment.

## MySQL Database Connector

This image contains solely the postgres metadata storage connector. If you
need the mysql metadata storage connector, you can use Dockerfile.mysql to add
it to the base image above.

`docker build -t apache/druid:tag-mysql --build-arg DRUID_RELEASE=apache/druid:tag -f distribution/docker/Dockerfile.mysql .`

where `druid:tag` is the version to use as the base.
