/**
 * Represents a task that can run on a worker. The general contracts surrounding Tasks are:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Tasks must operate on a single datasource.</li>
 *   <li>Tasks should be immutable, since the task ID is used as a proxy for the task in many locations.</li>
 *   <li>Task IDs must be unique. This can be done by naming them using UUIDs or the current timestamp.</li>
 *   <li>Tasks are each part of a "task group", which is a set of tasks that can share interval locks. These are
 *   useful for producing sharded segments.</li>
 *   <li>Tasks can optionally have an "implicit lock interval". Tasks with this property are guaranteed to have
 *   a lock on that interval during their {@link #preflight(com.metamx.druid.merger.common.actions.TaskActionClient)}
 *   and {@link #run(com.metamx.druid.merger.common.TaskToolbox)} methods.</li>
 *   <li>Tasks do not need to explicitly release locks; they are released upon task completion. Tasks may choose
 *   to release locks early if they desire.</li>
 * </ul>
