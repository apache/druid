/**
 * This is a "factory" interface for registering handlers in the system.  It exists because I'm unaware of
 * another way to register the complex serdes in the MR jobs that run on Hadoop.  As such, instances of this interface
 * must be instantiatable via a no argument default constructor (the MR jobs on Hadoop use reflection to instantiate
 * instances).
 *
 * The name is not a typo, I felt that it needed an extra "er" to make the pronunciation that much more difficult.
