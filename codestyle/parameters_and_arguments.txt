According to the Druid code style, if a method or constructor declaration or a call
doesn't fit a single line, each parameter or argument should be on it's own, e. g:

    MyReturnType myMethodWithAVeryLongName(
        MyParamTypeA myParamAWithAVeryLongName,
        MyParamTypeB myParamBWithAVeryLongName
    )

or

    MyValueType myValue = myMethodWithAVeryLongName(
        myVeryLongArgA,
        myVeryLongArgB
    )

Always prefer to fit a declaration or a method or constructor call into a single line
(less than 120 cols), if possible.

Two things to note to avoid unnecessary breakdown:

1) Exceptions declared for a method could be broken to the next line separately, e. g:

    MyReturnType myMethodWithAVeryLongName(MyParamTypeA myParamA, MyParamTypeB myParamB)
        throws MyExceptionTypeAWithVeryLongName, MyExceptionTypeBWithVeryLongName

2) In a variable, field or constant assignment, it's often more readable to break the
whole right hand side expression to the next line, instead of breaking the expression
arguments, e. g:

    MyTypeWithAVeryLongName myVariableWithAVeryLongName =
        myMethodWithAVeryLongName(myArgA, myArgB);

Also note that this checkstyle rule (the one that caused this message to be printed)
doesn't spot all violations of the corresponding Druid code style rule. If you see
a place where method or constructor parameters or call arguments are not properly
located each on it's own line, but this checkstyle rule is silent, if doesn't mean
that the code is formatted correctly. Fix it anyway.
