 * A Row of data.  This can be used for both input and output into various parts of the system.  It assumes
 * that the user already knows the schema of the row and can query for the parts that they care about.
 *
 * Note, Druid is a case-insensitive system for parts of schema (column names), this has direct implications
 * for the implementation of InputRows and Rows.  The case-insensitiveness is implemented by lowercasing all
 * schema elements before looking them up, this means that calls to getDimension() and getFloatMetric() will
 * have all lowercase column names passed in no matter what is returned from getDimensions or passed in as the
 * fieldName of an AggregatorFactory.  Implementations of InputRow and Row should expect to get values back
 * in all lowercase form (i.e. they should either have already turned everything into lowercase or they
 * should operate in a case-insensitive manner).
