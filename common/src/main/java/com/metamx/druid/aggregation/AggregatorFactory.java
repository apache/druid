 * This is useful as an abstraction to allow Aggregator classes to be written in terms of MetricSelector objects
 * without making any assumptions about how they are pulling values out of the base data.  That is, the data is
 * provided to the Aggregator through the MetricSelector object, so whatever creates that object gets to choose how
 * the data is actually stored and accessed.
