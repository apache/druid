  // NOTE: Setting negative nice values on linux systems (threadPriority > Thread.NORM_PRIORITY) requires running
  // as *ROOT*. This is, in general, not advisable.
  // In order to have these priorities honored on linux systems, the JVM must be launched with the following options:
  //
  //      -XX:+UseThreadPriorities -XX:ThreadPriorityPolicy=42
  //
  // +UseThreadPriorities usually only enables setting thread priorities if run as root... but
  // ThreadPriorityPolicy is "supposed" to be either 0 or 1, but there is a "bug"/feature in
  // the common JVMs. Whereby if UseThreadPriorities is set, and the  ThreadPriorityPolicy!=1
  // the check for "root" is skipped. This works fine as long as you are LOWERING the
  // threadPriority of tasks (which we are). If you modify the code to allow higher priorities
  // things will crash and burn at runtime. It is advisable to set it to 42 so that relevant searches can be found on
  // the flag
  //
  // Not setting these JVM options disables thread priorities on linux systems
  //
