/**
 * A synchronization tool for lifecycled objects (see {@link io.druid.java.util.common.lifecycle.Lifecycle}, that need
 * happens-before between start() and other methods and/or to check that the object was successfully started in other
 * methods.
 *
 * Guarantees in terms of JMM: happens-before between {@link #exitStart()} and {@link #awaitStarted()},
 * exitStart() and {@link #canStop()}, if it returns {@code true}.
 *
 * Example:
 * class ExampleLifecycledClass
 * {
 *   final LifecycleLock lifecycleLock = new LifecycleLock();
 *
 *   void start()
 *   {
 *     if (!lifecycleLock.canStart()) {
 *       .. return or throw exception
 *     }
 *     try {
 *       .. do start
 *       lifecycleLock.started();
 *     }
 *     finally {
 *       lifecycleLock.exitStart();
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   void otherMethod()
 *   {
 *     Preconditions.checkState(lifecycleLock.awaitStarted());
 *     // all actions done in start() are visible here
 *     .. do stuff
 *   }
 *
 *   void stop()
 *   {
 *     if (!lifecycleLock.canStop()) {
 *       .. return or throw exception
 *     }
 *     // all actions done in start() are visible here
