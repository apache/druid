# Pivot must have a state store in order to function
# The state (data cubes, dashboards, etc) can be stored in two ways.
# Choose just one option and comment out the other.
#
#  1) Stored in a sqlite file, editable at runtime with Settings View. Not suitable for running in a cluster.
#  2) Stored in a database, editable at runtime with Settings View. Works well with a cluster of Imply servers.
#

#
# 1) File-backed (sqlite) state (not suitable for running in a cluster)
#

stateStore:
  type: sqlite
  connection: var/pivot/pivot-settings.sqlite

#
# 2) Database-backed state 'mysql' (MySQL) or 'pg' (Postgres)
#

# stateStore:
#   location: mysql
#   connection: 'mysql://user:pw@192.168.99.100:3306/pivot'
