# Community Extensions

Please contribute all community extensions in this directory and include a doc of how your extension can be used under /docs/content/development/extensions-contrib/.

Please note that community extensions are maintained by their original contributors and are not packaged with the core Druid distribution. 
If you'd like to take on maintenance for a community extension, please post on [dev@druid.apache.org](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@druid.apache.org) to let us know!
