<!-- Builds a tar.gz file for the grpc-query extension. This file allows
     the IT to install this module easily. It also provides an all-in-one
     library for the module which avoids the need to use Druid's pull-deps
     feature to download dependencies. Most dependencies are already on
     Druid's class path: the tar.gz file includes only those jars unique
     to this module.
