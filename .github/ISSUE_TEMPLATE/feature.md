### Description

Please describe the feature or change with as much detail as possible. 

If you have a detailed implementation in mind and wish to contribute that implementation yourself, and the change that
you are planning would require a 'Design Review' tag because it introduces or changes some APIs, or it is large and
imposes lasting consequences on the codebase, please open a Proposal instead.

### Motivation

Please provide the following for the desired feature or change:
- A detailed description of the intended use case, if applicable
- Rationale for why the desired feature/change would be beneficial
