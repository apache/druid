<li>Griffin uses Zookeeper for coordination to provide redundancy and high availability of Kafka [31,36].</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Apache Hadoop</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.</li>
<li>The implementation of automatic HDFS failover relies on ZooKeeper for the following things:
<ul>
<li><strong>Failure detection</strong> - each of the NameNode machines in the cluster maintains a persistent session in ZooKeeper. If the machine crashes, the ZooKeeper session will expire, notifying the other NameNode that a failover should be triggered.</li>
<li><strong>Active NameNode election</strong> - ZooKeeper provides a simple mechanism to exclusively elect a node as active. If the current active NameNode crashes, another node may take a special exclusive lock in ZooKeeper indicating that it should become the next active.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The ZKFailoverController (ZKFC) is a new component which is a ZooKeeper client which also monitors and manages the state of the NameNode. Each of the machines which runs a NameNode also runs a ZKFC, and that ZKFC is responsible for:
<ul>
<li><strong>Health monitoring</strong> - the ZKFC pings its local NameNode on a periodic basis with a health-check command. So long as the NameNode responds in a timely fashion with a healthy status, the ZKFC considers the node healthy. If the node has crashed, frozen, or otherwise entered an unhealthy state, the health monitor will mark it as unhealthy.</li>
<li><strong>ZooKeeper session management</strong> - when the local NameNode is healthy, the ZKFC holds a session open in ZooKeeper. If the local NameNode is active, it also holds a special “lock” znode. This lock uses ZooKeeper’s support for “ephemeral” nodes; if the session expires, the lock node will be automatically deleted.</li>
<li><strong>ZooKeeper-based election</strong> - if the local NameNode is healthy, and the ZKFC sees that no other node currently holds the lock znode, it will itself try to acquire the lock. If it succeeds, then it has “won the election”, and is responsible for running a failover to make its local NameNode active. The failover process is similar to the manual failover described above: first, the previous active is fenced if necessary, and then the local NameNode transitions to active state [7].</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://hbase.apache.org/">Apache HBase</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>HBase is the Hadoop database. It's an open-source, distributed, column-oriented store model.</li>
<li>HBase uses ZooKeeper for master election, server lease management, bootstrapping, and coordination between servers. A distributed Apache HBase installation depends on a running ZooKeeper cluster. All participating nodes and clients need to be able to access the running ZooKeeper ensemble [8].</li>
<li>As you can see, ZooKeeper is a fundamental part of HBase. All operations that require coordination, such as Regions assignment, Master-Failover, replication, and snapshots, are built on ZooKeeper [20].</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="http://helix.apache.org/">Apache Helix</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>A cluster management framework for partitioned and replicated distributed resources.</li>
<li>We need a distributed store to maintain the state of the cluster and a notification system to notify if there is any change in the cluster state. Helix uses Apache ZooKeeper to achieve this functionality [21]. Zookeeper provides:
<ul>
<li>A way to represent PERSISTENT state which remains until its deleted</li>
<li>A way to represent TRANSIENT/EPHEMERAL state which vanishes when the process that created the state dies</li>
<li>A notification mechanism when there is a change in PERSISTENT and EPHEMERAL state</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://hive.apache.org">Apache Hive</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The Apache Hive data warehouse software facilitates reading, writing, and managing large datasets residing in distributed storage using SQL. Structure can be projected onto data already in storage. A command line tool and JDBC driver are provided to connect users to Hive.</li>
<li>Hive has been using ZooKeeper as distributed lock manager to support concurrency in HiveServer2 [25,26].</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://ignite.apache.org/">Apache Ignite</a></h3>

<li>Uses Zookeeper and Curator Framework for generating distributed unique ID's [31].</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Kafka is a distributed publish/subscribe messaging system</li>
<li>Apache Kafka relies on ZooKeeper for the following things:
<ul>
<li><strong>Controller election</strong> The controller is one of the most important broking entity in a Kafka ecosystem, and it also has the responsibility to maintain the leader-follower relationship across all the partitions. If a node by some reason is shutting down, it’s the controller’s responsibility to tell all the replicas to act as partition leaders in order to fulfill the duties of the partition leaders on the node that is about to fail. So, whenever a node shuts down, a new controller can be elected and it can also be made sure that at any given time, there is only one controller and all the follower nodes have agreed on that.</li>
<li><strong>Configuration Of Topics</strong> The configuration regarding all the topics including the list of existing topics, the number of partitions for each topic, the location of all the replicas, list of configuration overrides for all topics and which node is the preferred leader, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Access control lists</strong> Access control lists or ACLs for all the topics are also maintained within Zookeeper.</li>
<li><strong>Membership of the cluster</strong> Zookeeper also maintains a list of all the brokers that are functioning at any given moment and are a part of the cluster [9].</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="http://mesos.apache.org/">Apache Mesos</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away from machines (physical or virtual), enabling fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and run effectively.</li>
<li>Mesos has a high-availability mode that uses multiple Mesos masters: one active master (called the leader or leading master) and several backups in case it fails. The masters elect the leader, with Apache ZooKeeper both coordinating the election and handling leader detection by masters, agents, and scheduler drivers [10].</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://oozie.apache.org">Apache Oozie</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Oozie is a workflow scheduler system to manage Apache Hadoop jobs.</li>
<li>the Oozie servers use it for coordinating access to the database and communicating with each other. In order to have full HA, there should be at least 3 ZooKeeper servers [29].</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://pulsar.apache.org">Apache Pulsar</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Apache Pulsar is an open-source distributed pub-sub messaging system originally created at Yahoo and now part of the Apache Software Foundation</li>
<li>Pulsar uses Apache Zookeeper for metadata storage, cluster configuration, and coordination. In a Pulsar instance:
<ul>
<li>A configuration store quorum stores configuration for tenants, namespaces, and other entities that need to be globally consistent.</li>
<li>Each cluster has its own local ZooKeeper ensemble that stores cluster-specific configuration and coordination such as ownership metadata, broker load reports, BookKeeper ledger metadata, and more [24].</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Solr is the popular, blazing-fast, open source enterprise search platform built on Apache Lucene.</li>
<li>In the &quot;Cloud&quot; edition (v4.x and up) of enterprise search engine Apache Solr, ZooKeeper is used for configuration, leader election and more [12,13].</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.</li>
<li>Utilizing ZooKeeper to provide leader election and some state storage, you can launch multiple Masters in your cluster connected to the same ZooKeeper instance. One will be elected “leader” and the others will remain in standby mode. If the current leader dies, another Master will be elected, recover the old Master’s state, and then resume scheduling [14].</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="http://storm.apache.org">Apache Storm</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Apache Storm is a free and open source distributed realtime computation system. Apache Storm makes it easy to reliably process unbounded streams of data, doing for realtime processing what Hadoop did for batch processing. Apache Storm is simple, can be used with any programming language, and is a lot of fun to use!</li>
<li>Storm uses Zookeeper for coordinating the cluster [22].</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Pinterest uses the ZooKeeper for Service discovery and dynamic configuration.Like many large scale web sites, Pinterest’s infrastructure consists of servers that communicate with backend services composed of a number of individual servers for managing load and fault tolerance. Ideally, we’d like the configuration to reflect only the active hosts, so clients don’t need to deal with bad hosts as often. ZooKeeper provides a well known pattern to solve this problem [19].</li>
</ul>
