NOTICE: THIS SET OF JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS AND DOCKER COMPOSE STACK HAS MOVED

The notebooks and docker-compose configuration continue to be improved as part of a new project dedicated to 
making it easy to start using and learning Druid directly on your computer. It now contains a data generator service, 
kafka, druid and jupyter notebooks that guide you through data ingestion in batch & streaming, query strategies and 
modeling.

You can find the new project home at:
