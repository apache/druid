    "This notebook provides a quick introduction to the Python wrapper around the [Druid REST API](api-tutorial.ipynb). This notebook assumes you are familiar with the basics of the REST API, and the [set of operations which Druid provides](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/operations/api-reference.html). This tutorial focuses on using Python to access those APIs rather than explaining the APIs themselves. The APIs themselves are covered in other notebooks that use the Python API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Druid Python API is primarily intended to help with these notebook tutorials. It can also be used in your own ad-hoc notebooks, or in a regular Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Druid Python API is a work in progress. The Druid team adds API wrappers as needed for the notebook tutorials. If you find you need additional wrappers, please feel free to add them, and post a PR to Apache Druid with your additions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API provides two levels of functions. Most are simple wrappers around Druid's REST APIs. Others add additional code to make the API easier to use. The SQL query interface is a prime example: extra code translates a simple SQL query into Druid's `SQLQuery` object and interprets the results into a form that can be displayed in a notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains sample output to allow it to function as a reference. To run it yourself, start by using the `Kernel` &rarr; `Restart & Clear Output` menu command to clear the sample output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by importing the `druidapi` package from the same folder as this notebook."

    "This notebook have you a whirlwind tour of the Python Druid API: just enough to check your cluster, ingest some data with MSQ and query that data. Druid has many more APIs. As noted earlier, the Python API is a work in progress: the team adds new wrappers as needed for tutorials. Your [contributions](https://github.com/apache/druid/pulls) and [feedback](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues) are welcome."
