    "- Checking if your cluster is up\n",

    "- Querying data\n",
    "\n",
    "Different [Druid server types](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/design/processes.html#server-types)  are responsible for handling different APIs for the Druid services. For example, the Overlord service on the Master server provides the status of a task. You'll also interact the Broker service on the Query Server to see what datasources are available. And to run queries, you'll interact with the Broker. The Router service on the Query servers routes API calls.\n",

So download that and start it if you haven't already. In the root of the Druid folder, run the following command to start Druid:\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, you'll need either JupyterLab (recommended) or Jupyter Notebook. Both the quickstart Druid cluster and Jupyter are deployed at `localhost:8888` by default, so you'll \n",
    "need to change the port for Jupyter. To do so, stop Jupyter and start it again with the `port` parameter included. For example, you can use the following command to start Jupyter on port `3001`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# If you're using JupyterLab\n",
    "jupyter lab --port 3001\n",

    "- Saves the response to a unique variable that you can reference later to identify this ingestion task\n",

    "The MSQ task engine uses a task to ingest data. The response for the API includes a `taskId` and `state` for your ingestion. You can use this `taskId` to reference this task later on to get more information about it.\n",

    "\n",
    "-  **`__time`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   The `__time` column is a key concept for Druid. It's the default partition for Druid and is treated as the primary timestamp. Use it to help you write faster and more efficient queries. Big datasets, such as those for event data, typically have a time component. This means that instead of writing a query using only `COUNT`, you can combine that with `WHERE __time` to return results much more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **`PARTITIONED BY DAY`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   If you partition by day, Druid creates segment files within the partition based on the day. You can only replace, delete and update data at the partition level. So when you're deciding how to partition data, make the partition large enough (min 500,000 rows) for good performance but not so big that those operations become impractical to run.\n",
