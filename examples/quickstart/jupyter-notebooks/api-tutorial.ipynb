    "- Checking if your cluster is up\n",
    "- Ingesting data\n",
    "- Querying data\n",
    "- Deleting data\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Druid deployment, you have [Mastery, Query, and Data servers](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/design/processes.html#server-types) that all fulfill different purposes. The endpoint you use for a certain action is determined, partially, by which server governs that part of Druid and the processes that run on that server type. That's why the [API reference](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/operations/api-reference.html#historical) is organized by server type and process.\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "pip3 install requests\n",
    "```\n",

    "Next, you'll need a Druid cluster. This tutorial uses the `micro-quickstart` config described in the [Druid quickstart](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/index.html). So download that and start it if you haven't already. In the root of the Druid folder, run the following command to start Druid:\n",

    "./bin/start-micro-quickstart\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you'll need either Jupyter lab (recommended) or Jupyter notebook. Both the quickstart Druid cluster and Jupyter notebook are deployed at `localhost:8888` by default, so you'll \n",
    "need to change the port for Jupyter. To do so, stop Jupyter and start it again with the `port` parameter included. For example, you can use the following command to start Jupyter on port `3001`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# If you're using Jupyter lab\n",
    "jupyter lab --port 3001\n",
    "# If you're using Jupyter notebook\n",
    "jupyter notebook --port 3001 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To start this tutorial, run the next cell. It imports the Python packages you'll need and defines a variable for the the Druid host the tutorial uses. The quickstart deployment configures Druid to listen on port `8888` by default, so you'll be making API calls against `http://localhost:8888`. "
