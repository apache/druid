    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To get this far, you've installed Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook. Make sure you meet the following requirements before starting the Jupyter-based tutorials:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `requests` package for Python. For example, you can install it with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install requests\n",
    "   ````\n",
    "\n",
    "- JupyterLab (recommended) or Jupyter Notebook running on a non-default port. By default, Druid\n",
    "  and Jupyter both try to use port `8888`, so start Jupyter on a different port.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An available Druid instance. You can use the local quickstart configuration\n",
    "  described in [Quickstart](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/index.html).\n",
    "  The tutorials assume that you are using the quickstart, so no authentication or authorization\n",
    "  is expected unless explicitly mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Druid API\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the notebooks shows how to use the Druid REST API. The others focus on other\n",
    "topics and use a simple set of Python wrappers around the underlying REST API. The\n",
    "wrappers reside in the `druidapi` package within this directory. While the package\n",
    "can be used in any Python program, the key purpose, at present, is to support these\n",
    "notebooks. See the [Introduction to the Druid Python API](Python_API_Tutorial.ipynb)\n",
    "for an overview of the Python API."

    "## Contributing\n",
    "\n",
    "If you build a Jupyter tutorial, you need to do a few things to add it to the docs\n",
    "in addition to saving the notebook in this directory. The process requires two PRs to the repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first PR, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Depending on the goal of the notebook, you may want to clear the outputs from your notebook\n",
    "   before you make the PR. You can use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   jupyter nbconvert --ClearOutputPreprocessor.enabled=True --inplace ./path/to/notebook/notebookName.ipynb\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This can also be done in Jupyter Notebook itself: `Kernel` &rarr; `Restart & Clear Output`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create the PR as you normally would. Make sure to note that this PR is the one that\n",
    "   contains only the Jupyter notebook and that there will be a subsequent PR that updates\n",
    "   related pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After this first PR is merged, grab the \"raw\" URL for the file from GitHub. For example,\n",
    "   navigate to the file in the GitHub web UI and select **Raw**. Use the URL for this in the\n",
    "   second PR as the download link.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second PR, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Update the list of [Tutorials](#tutorials) on this page and in the\n",
    "   [Jupyter tutorial index page](../../../docs/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-index.md#tutorials)\n",
    "   in the `docs/tutorials` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Update `tutorial-jupyter-index.md` and provide the URL to the raw version of the file\n",
    "   that becomes available after the first PR is merged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can skip the second PR, if you just copy the prefix link from one of the\n",
    "existing notebook links when doing your first PR."
