    "It's extremely common for analysts to want to count unique occurences of some dimension value in data. With the Druid database's history of large volumes of data comes an advanced computer science technique to speed up this calculation through approximation. In this tutorial, work through some examples and see the effect of turning it on and off, and of making it even faster by pre-generating the objects that Druid uses to execute the query."

In a `COUNT(DISTINCT)` query, each process its own set of results, passes these back, and then computation is done to find the result. Without estimation, especially when the dimension being looked at contains many tens-of-thousands, perhaps even millions of unique values, the transfer of intermediate results and the final computation can be both memory and CPU hungry.\n",
