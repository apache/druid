    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Approximation is the default execution model for `COUNT(DISTINCT)` queries\n",
    "* You can turn it off with a query context parameter\n",
    "* Accuracy is governed by the size and mode of the data sketch and by the operations you perform.\n",
    "* HyperLogLog and Theta sketches both allow you to approximate `COUNT(DISTINCT)` of entire sets\n",
    "* Only Theta sketches allow you to carry out set operations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Go further\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try estimation on your own dataset:\n",
    "    * Identify a high-cardinality column in one of your own datasets\n",
    "    * Test how long an approximate `DISTINCT(COUNT)` query takes to run with approximation turned on\n",
    "    * Test how long the same query takes to run with approximation turned off\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learn more\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read the [Theta sketch](https://druid.apache.org/docs/26.0.0/development/extensions-core/datasketches-theta.html) documentation for reference on ingestion and native queries on Theta sketches in Druid.\n",
    "* Review the [Theta sketch scalar functions](https://druid.apache.org/docs/26.0.0/querying/sql-scalar.html#theta-sketch-functions) and [Theta sketch aggregation functions](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/sql-aggregations.html#theta-sketch-functions) documentation.\n",
    "* Read [Sketches for high cardinality columns](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/schema-design.html#sketches-for-high-cardinality-columns) in the schema design guidance.\n",
    "* Peek at the [DataSketches extension](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/development/extensions-core/datasketches-extension.html) documentation for information about other available sketches.\n",
