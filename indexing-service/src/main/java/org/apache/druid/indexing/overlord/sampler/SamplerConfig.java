   * {@link InputRowListPlusJson#getRaw()} must be non-null) and 2) the parser must be an
   * implementation of {@link org.apache.druid.data.input.ByteBufferInputRowParser} since the data is cached as a byte
   * array. If these conditions are not satisfied, the cache returns a miss and the sampler would read from source.
