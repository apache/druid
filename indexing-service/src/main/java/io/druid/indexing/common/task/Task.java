/**
 * Represents a task that can run on a worker. The general contracts surrounding Tasks are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Tasks must operate on a single datasource.</li>
 * <li>Tasks should be immutable, since the task ID is used as a proxy for the task in many locations.</li>
 * <li>Task IDs must be unique. This can be done by naming them using UUIDs or the current timestamp.</li>
 * <li>Tasks are each part of a "task group", which is a set of tasks that can share interval locks. These are
 * useful for producing sharded segments.</li>
 * <li>Tasks do not need to explicitly release locks; they are released upon task completion. Tasks may choose
 * to release locks early if they desire.</li>
 * </ul>
