## Druid

Druid is a distributed, column-oriented, real-time analytics data store that is
commonly used to power exploratory dashboards in multi-tenant environments.
Druid excels as a data warehousing solution for fast aggregate queries on
petabyte sized data sets. Druid supports a variety of flexible filters, exact
calculations, approximate algorithms, and other useful calculations. Druid can
load both streaming and batch data and integrates with Storm and Hadoop.
