## Druid

Druid is a distributed, column-oriented, real-time analytics data store
that is commonly used to power exploratory dashboards in multi-tenant
environments.

Druid excels as a data warehousing solution for fast aggregate queries on
petabyte sized data sets. Druid supports a variety of flexible filters, exact
calculations, approximate algorithms, and other useful calculations.

Druid can load both streaming and batch data and integrates with
Samza, Kafka, Storm, and Hadoop among others.
