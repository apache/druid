## Apache Druid

Druid is a high performance real-time analytics database. Druid's main value add is to reduce time to insight and action.

Druid is designed for workflows where fast queries and ingest really matter. Druid excels at powering UIs, running operational (ad-hoc) queries, or handling high concurrency. Consider Druid as an open source alternative to data warehouses for a variety of use cases.

### Getting started

You can get started with Druid with our [local](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/quickstart.html) or [Docker](http://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/docker.html) quickstart.

Druid provides a rich set of APIs (via HTTP and [JDBC](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/sql.html#jdbc)) for loading, managing, and querying your data.
You can also interact with Druid via the [built-in console](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/operations/druid-console.html) (shown below).

#### Load data

[![data loader Kafka](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/65819337-054eac80-e1d0-11e9-8842-97b92d8c6159.gif)](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/index.html)

Load [streaming](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/index.html#streaming) and [batch](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/index.html#batch) data using a point-and-click wizard to guide you through ingestion setup. Monitor one off tasks and ingestion supervisors.

#### Manage the cluster

[![management](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/65819338-08499d00-e1d0-11e9-80fe-faee9e9468cb.gif)](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/data-management.html)

Manage your cluster with ease. Get a view of your [datasources](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/design/architecture.html), [segments](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/design/segments.html), [ingestion tasks](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/tasks.html), and [services](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/design/processes.html) from one convenient location. All powered by [SQL systems tables](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/sql.html#metadata-tables), allowing you to see the underlying query for each view.

#### Issue queries

[![query view combo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/65819341-0c75ba80-e1d0-11e9-9730-0f2d084defcc.gif)](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/sql.html)

Use the built-in query workbench to prototype [DruidSQL](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/sql.html) and [native](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/querying.html) queries or connect one of the [many tools](https://druid.apache.org/libraries.html) that help you make the most out of Druid.
