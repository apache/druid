/**
 * Signifies that the annotated entity is a public API for extension authors. Public APIs may change in breaking ways
 * only between major Druid release lines (e.g. 0.10.x -> 0.11.0), but otherwise must remain stable. Public APIs may
 * change at any time in non-breaking ways, however, such as by adding new fields, methods, or constructors.
 *
 * Note that interfaces annotated with {@code PublicApi} but not with {@link ExtensionPoint} are not meant to be
 * subclassed in extensions. In this case, the annotation simply signifies that the interface is stable for callers.
 * In particular, since it is not meant to be subclassed, new non-default methods may be added to an interface and
 * new abstract methods may be added to a class.
 *
 * If a class or interface is annotated, then all public and protected fields, methods, and constructors that class
 * or interface are considered stable in this sense. If a class is not annotated, but an individual field, method, or
 * constructor is annotated, then only that particular field, method, or constructor is considered a public API.
 *
 * Classes, fields, method, and constructors _not_ annotated with {@code @PublicApi} may be modified or removed
 * in any Druid release, unless they are annotated with {@link ExtensionPoint} (which implies they are a public API
 * as well).
 *
