/**
 * Signifies that the annotated type is an extension point. Extension points are interfaces or non-final classes that
 * may be subclassed in extensions in order to add functionality to Druid. Extension points may change in breaking ways
 * only between major Druid release lines (e.g. 0.10.x -> 0.11.0), but otherwise must remain stable. Extension points
 * may change at any time in non-breaking ways, however, such as by adding new default methods to an interface.
 *
 * All public and protected fields, methods, and constructors of annotated classes and interfaces are considered
 * stable in this sense. If a class is not annotated, but an individual field, method, or constructor is
 * annotated, then only that particular field, method, or constructor is considered an extension API.
 *
 * Extension points are all considered public APIs in the sense of {@link PublicApi}, even if not explicitly annotated
 * as such.
 *
 * Note that there are number of injectable interfaces that are not annotated with {@code ExtensionPoint}. You may
 * still extend these interfaces in extensions, but your extension may need to be recompiled even for a minor
 * update of Druid.
