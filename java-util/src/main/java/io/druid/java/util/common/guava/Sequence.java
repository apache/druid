/**
 * A Sequence represents an iterable sequence of elements. Unlike normal Iterators however, it doesn't expose
 * a way for you to extract values from it, instead you provide it with a worker (an Accumulator) and that defines
 * what happens with the data.
 * <p>
 * This inversion of control is in place to allow the Sequence to do resource management. It can enforce that close()
 * methods get called and other resources get cleaned up whenever processing is complete. Without this inversion
 * it is very easy to unintentionally leak resources when iterating over something that is backed by a resource.
 * <p>
 * Sequences also expose {#see com.metamx.common.guava.Yielder} Yielder objects which allow you to implement a
 * continuation over the Sequence. Yielder do not offer the same guarantees of automatic resource management
 * as the accumulate method, but they are Closeable and will do the proper cleanup when close() is called on them.
