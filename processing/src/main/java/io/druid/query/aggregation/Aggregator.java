 * An Aggregator is an object that can aggregate metrics.  Its aggregation-related methods (namely, aggregate() and get())
 * do not take any arguments as the assumption is that the Aggregator was given something in its constructor that
 * it can use to get at the next bit of data.
 *
 * Thus, an Aggregator can be thought of as a closure over some other thing that is stateful and changes between calls
 * to aggregate(). This is currently (as of this documentation) implemented through the use of {@link
 * io.druid.segment.ColumnValueSelector} objects.
