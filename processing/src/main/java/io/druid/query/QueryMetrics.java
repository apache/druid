/**
 * Abstraction wrapping {@link com.metamx.emitter.service.ServiceMetricEvent.Builder} and allowing to control what
 * metrics are actually emitted, what dimensions do they have, etc.
 *
 *
 * Goals of QueryMetrics
 * ---------------------
 *  1. Skipping or partial filtering of particular dimensions or metrics entirely. Implementation could leave the body
 *  of the corresponding method empty, or implement random filtering like:
 *  public void reportCpuTime(long timeNs)
 *  {
 *    if (ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextDouble() < 0.1) {
 *      super.reportCpuTime(timeNs);
 *    }
 *  }
 *
 *  2. Ability to add new dimensions and metrics, possibly expensive to compute, or expensive to process (long string
 *  values, high cardinality, etc.) and not to affect existing Druid installations, by skipping (see 1.) those
 *  dimensions and metrics entirely in the default QueryMetrics implementations. Users who need those expensive
 *  dimensions and metrics, could explicitly emit them in their own QueryMetrics.
 *
 *  3. Control over the time unit, in which time metrics are emitted. By default (see {@link DefaultQueryMetrics} and
 *  it's subclasses) it's milliseconds, but if queries are fast, it could be not precise enough.
 *
 *  4. Control over the dimension and metric names.
 *
 *  Here, "control" is provided to the operator of a Druid cluster, who would exercise that control through a
 *  site-specific extension adding XxxQueryMetricsFactory impl(s).
 *
 *
 * Types of methods in this interface
 * ----------------------------------
 *  1. Methods, pulling some dimensions from the query object. These methods are used to populate the metric before the
 *  query is run. These methods accept a single `QueryType query` parameter. {@link #query(Query)} calls all methods
 *  of this type, hence pulling all available information from the query object as dimensions.
 *
 *  2. Methods for setting dimensions, which become known in the process of the query execution or after the query is
 *  completed.
 *
 *  3. Methods to register metrics to be emitted later in bulk via {@link #emit(ServiceEmitter)}. These methods
 *  return this QueryMetrics object back for chaining. Names of these methods start with "report" prefix.
 *
 *
 * Implementors expectations
 * -------------------------
 * QueryMetrics is expected to be changed often, in every Druid release (including "patch" releases). Users who create
 * their custom implementations of QueryMetrics should be ready to fix the code of their QueryMetrics (implement new
 * methods) when they update Druid. Broken builds of custom extensions, containing custom QueryMetrics is the way to
 * notify users that Druid core "wants" to emit new dimension or metric, and the user handles them manually: if the new
 * dimension or metric is useful and not very expensive to process and store then emit, skip (see above Goals, 1.)
 * otherwise.
 *
 * <p>If implementors of custom QueryMetrics don't want to fix builds on every Druid release (e. g. if they want to add
 * a single dimension to emitted events and don't want to alter other dimensions and emitted metrics), they could
 * inherit their custom QueryMetrics from {@link DefaultQueryMetrics} or query-specific default implementation class,
 * such as {@link io.druid.query.topn.DefaultTopNQueryMetrics}. Those classes are guaranteed to stay around and
 * implement new methods, added to the QueryMetrics interface (or a query-specific subinterface). However, there is no
 * 100% guarantee of compatibility, because methods could not only be added to QueryMetrics, existing methods could also
 * be changed or removed.
 *
 * <p>QueryMetrics is designed for use from a single thread, implementations shouldn't care about thread-safety.
 *
 *
 * Adding new methods to QueryMetrics
 * ----------------------------------
 * 1. When adding a new method for setting a dimension, which could be pulled from the query object, always make them
 * accept a single `QueryType query` parameter, letting the implementations to do all the work of carving the dimension
 * value out of the query object.
 *
 * 2. When adding a new method for setting a dimension, which becomes known in the process of the query execution or
 * after the query is completed, design it so that as little work as possible is done for preparing arguments for this
 * method, and as much work as possible is done in the implementations of this method, if they decide to actually emit
 * this dimension.
 *
 * 3. When adding a new method for registering metrics, make it to accept the metric value in the smallest reasonable
 * unit (i. e. nanoseconds for time metrics, bytes for metrics of data size, etc.), allowing the implementations of
 * this method to round the value up to more coarse-grained units, if they don't need the maximum precision.
 *
 *
 * Making subinterfaces of QueryMetrics for emitting custom dimensions and/or metrics for specific query types
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * If a query type (e. g. {@link io.druid.query.search.search.SearchQuery} (it's runners) needs to emit custom
 * dimensions and/or metrics which doesn't make sense for all other query types, the following steps should be executed:
 *  1. Create `interface SearchQueryMetrics extends QueryMetrics` (here and below "Search" is the query type) with
 *  additional methods (see "Adding new methods" section above).
 *
 *  2. Create `class DefaultSearchQueryMetrics implements SearchQueryMetrics`. This class should implement extra methods
 *  from SearchQueryMetrics interfaces with empty bodies, AND DELEGATE ALL OTHER METHODS TO A QueryMetrics OBJECT,
 *  provided as a sole parameter in DefaultSearchQueryMetrics constructor.
 *
 *  3. Create `interface SearchQueryMetricsFactory` with a single method
 *  `SearchQueryMetrics makeMetrics(SearchQuery query);`.
 *
 *  4. Create `class DefaultSearchQueryMetricsFactory implements SearchQueryMetricsFactory`, which accepts {@link
 *  GenericQueryMetricsFactory} as injected constructor parameter, and implements makeMetrics() as
 *  `return new DefaultSearchQueryMetrics(genericQueryMetricsFactory.makeMetrics(query));`
 *
 *  5. Inject and use SearchQueryMetricsFactory instead of {@link GenericQueryMetricsFactory} in {@link
 *  io.druid.query.search.SearchQueryQueryToolChest}.
 *
 *  6. Specify `binder.bind(SearchQueryMetricsFactory.class).to(DefaultSearchQueryMetricsFactory.class)` in
 *  QueryToolChestModule (if the query type belongs to the core druid-processing, e. g. SearchQuery) or in some
 *  extension-specific Guice module otherwise, if the query type is defined in an extension, e. g. ScanQuery.
 *
 * This complex procedure is needed to ensure custom {@link GenericQueryMetricsFactory} specified by users still works
 * for the query type when query type decides to create their custom QueryMetrics subclass.
 *
 * {@link io.druid.query.topn.TopNQueryMetrics}, {@link io.druid.query.groupby.GroupByQueryMetrics}, and {@link
 * io.druid.query.timeseries.TimeseriesQueryMetrics} are implemented differently, because they are introduced at the
 * same time as the whole QueryMetrics abstraction and their default implementations have to actually emit more
 * dimensions than the default generic QueryMetrics. So those subinterfaces shouldn't be taken as direct examples for
 * following the plan specified above.
