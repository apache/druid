/**
 * Processing related interface
 *
 * A DimensionMerger is a per-dimension stateful object that encapsulates type-specific operations and data structures
 * used during the segment merging process (i.e., work done by IndexMerger/IndexMergerV9).
 *
 * This object is responsible for:
 *   - merging any relevant structures from the segments (e.g., encoding dictionaries)
 *   - writing the merged column data and any merged indexing structures (e.g., dictionaries, bitmaps) to disk
 *
 * At a high level, the index merging process can be broken down into the following steps:
 *   - Merge any value representation metadata across segments
 *     E.g. for dictionary encoded Strings, each segment has its own unique space of id->value mappings.
 *     These need to be merged across segments into a shared space of dictionary mappings.
 *
 *   - Merge the rows across segments into a common sequence of rows
 *
 *   - After constructing the merged sequence of rows, build any applicable index structures (e.g, bitmap indexes)
 *
 *   - Write the value representation metadata (e.g. dictionary), the sequence of row values,
 *     and index structures to a merged segment.
 *
 * A class implementing this interface is expected to be highly stateful, updating its internal state as these
 * functions are called.
