/**
 * The "mutable" version of a ReadableOffset.  Introduces "increment()" and "withinBounds()" methods, which are
 * very similar to "next()" and "hasNext()" on the Iterator interface except increment() does not return a value.
 * 
 * This class is not thread-safe, all it's methods, including {@link #reset()} and {@link #clone()}, must be called
 * from a single thread.
 *
 * Annotated with {@link SubclassesMustBePublic} because Offset occurrences are replaced with a subclass in {@link
 * io.druid.query.topn.Historical1SimpleDoubleAggPooledTopNScannerPrototype} and {@link
 * io.druid.query.topn.HistoricalSingleValueDimSelector1SimpleDoubleAggPooledTopNScannerPrototype} during
 * specialization, and specialized version of those prototypes must be able to any subclass of Offset.
 *
 * This interface is the core "pointer" interface that is used to create {@link io.druid.segment.ColumnValueSelector}s
 * over historical segments. It's counterpart for incremental index is {@link
 * io.druid.segment.incremental.IncrementalIndexRowHolder}.
