/**
 * A row transform that is part of a {@link TransformSpec}. Transforms allow adding new fields to input rows. Each
 * one has a "name" (the name of the new field) which can be referred to by DimensionSpecs, AggregatorFactories, etc.
 * Each also has a "row function", which produces values for this new field based on looking at the entire input row.
 * <p>
 * If a transform has the same name as a field in an input row, then it will shadow the original field. Transforms
 * that shadow fields may still refer to the fields they shadow. This can be used to transform a field "in-place".
 * <p>
 * Transforms do have some limitations. They can only refer to fields present in the actual input rows; in particular,
 * they cannot refer to other transforms. And they cannot remove fields, only add them. However, they can shadow a
 * field with another field containing all nulls, which will act similarly to removing the field.
