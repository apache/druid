/**
 * Represents an error condition exposed to the user and/or operator of Druid.  Given that a DruidException is intended
 * to be delivered to the end user, it should generally never be caught.  DruidExceptions are generated at terminal
 * points where the operation that was happening cannot make forward progress.  As such, the only reason to catch a
 * DruidException is if the code has some extra context that it wants to add to the message of the DruidException using
 * {@link #prependAndBuild(String, Object...)}.  If code wants to catch and handle an exception instead, it should not
 * be using the DruidException.
 * <p>
 * Said another way, when a developer builds a DruidException in the code, they should be confident that the exception
 * will make its way back to the user.  DruidException is always the answer to "how do I generate an error message and
 * deliver it to the user"?
 * <p>
 * At the time that DruidException was introduced, this type of "show this to the user please" exception was largely
 * handled by created {@link org.apache.druid.java.util.common.RE}, {@link org.apache.druid.java.util.common.IAE}, or
 * {@link org.apache.druid.java.util.common.ISE} objects.  It is intended that DruidException replaces all usage of
 * these exceptions where the intention is to deliver a message to the user, which we believe to be the vast majority
 * of usages.  In cases where those exceptions are with the intention of being caught and acted upon, they should
 * no change should occur.
 *
 * <h>Notes about exception messages</h>
 * <p>
 * Firstly, exception messages should always be written with the notions from the style conventions covered in
 * {@code dev/style-conventions.md}.  Whenever possible, we should also try to provide an action to take to resolve
 * the issue.
 * <p>
 * Secondly, given that the DruidException requires defining a target persona, exception messages should always be
 * written with that target persona in mind.  Reviewers should use the targetPersona as added input to help validate
 * that an exception message in meaningful.
 * <p>
 * For example, at the time that this exception was introduced, there is an exception that the router throws which is
 * an {@link org.apache.druid.java.util.common.ISE} with the message {@code "No default server found!"}.  This
 * exception is thrown when the router is unable to find a broker to forward a request to.  It is completely
 * meaningless to an end-user trying to run a query (what's a default server?  why does it need to be found?).  If we
 * were to convert the exception to a DruidException and keep the same message, we should mark it as targeting the
 * DEVELOPER persona as that is the only persona who should actually be able to figure out what a default server is
 * and why it is important.  That said, does it make sense for an exception that means "router cannot find a broker
 * to forward the query to" to only be targeting the DEVELOPER?  The answer to that is no, it's something that should
 * really be made meaningful to a wider group. Some options could be
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>USER</b> persona: Cannot find a queryable server, contact your cluster administrator to validate that all services are
 * operational</li>
 * <li><b>OPERATOR</b> persona: Router unable to find a broker, check that brokers are up and active</li>
 * </ul>
 * The user-facing message doesn't talk about any Druid-specific concepts and just tries to relay a high-level
 * understanding of what happened.  The admin-facing message includes Druid notions in it as it expects that an Admin
 * will understand the various node types of Druid.
 * <p>
 * If we think about this error more, we will realize that it's fundamentally something wrong with the cluster setup,
 * which is something that we would expect an operator to be in charge of.  So, we would pick the OPERATOR persona
 * message, which also allows us to include more specific information about what server was not found and provide a
 * more meaningful action to take (check the health of your brokers).
 *
 * <h>Description of fields of DruidException</h>
 * Every error consists of:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A target persona</li>
 * <li>A categorization of the error</li>
 * <li>An error code</li>
 * <li>An error message</li>
 * <li>A context (possibly empty)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The target persona indicates who the message is written for.  This is important for 2 reasons
 * <ol>
 *   <li>It identifies why the developer is creating the exception and who they believe can take action on it.
 *   This context allows for code reviewers and other developers to evaluate the message with the persona in mind</li>
 *   <li>It can be used as a way to control which error messages should be routed where.  For example, a user-targeted
 *   error message should be able to be exposed directly to the user, while an operator-targeted error message should
 *   perhaps be routed to the operators of the system instead of the end user firing a query.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The category indicates what kind of failure occurred.  This is leveraged to align response codes (e.g. HTTP response
 * codes) for similar exception messages.
 * <p>
 * The error code is a code that indicates a grouping of error messages.  There is no forced structure around whether
 * a specific error code can be reused for different problems or not.  That is, an error code like "general" will get
 * reused in many places as it's the basic error code used whenever a DruidException is created in-line.  But,
 * we might decide that a specific type of error should be identified explicitly by its error code and should only mean
 * one thing, in which case that error code might only exist on a single error.
 * <p>
 * The error message is a message written targeting the target persona.  It should have values interpolated into it
 * in order to be as meaningful as possible for the target persona without leaking potentially sensitive information.
 * <p>
 * The context is a place to add extra information about the error that is not necessarily interpolated into the
 * error message.  It's a way to carry extra information that might be useful to a developer, but not necessarily to
 * the target persona.
 *
 * <h>Notes for developers working with DruidException</h>
 * <p>
 * A DruidException can be built from one of 2 static methods: {@link #forPersona} or {@link #fromFailure(Failure)}.
 * The only way to set a specific error code is to build a DruidException from a Failure, when built in-line using
 * forPersona, it will always be an "general" error.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, DruidException is not intended to be directly serialized.  The intention is that something converts
 * it into an {@link ErrorResponse} first using {@link ErrorResponse#ErrorResponse(DruidException)} and then that
 * ErrorResponse is used for serialization.  DruidException carries a {@link #toErrorResponse()} method because there
 * are some code paths that directly serialize Exceptions and adjusting them was deemed out-of-scope for the PR that
 * introduced DruidException.
