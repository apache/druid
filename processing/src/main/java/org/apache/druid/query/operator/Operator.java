/**
 * An Operator interface that intends to have implementations that align relatively closely with the Operators that
 * other databases would also tend to be implemented using.  While a lot of Operator interfaces tend to use a
 * pull-based orientation, we use a push-based interface.  This is to give us good stacktraces.  Because of the
 * organization of the go() method, the stack traces thrown out of an Operator will be
 * 1. All of the go() calls from the top-level Operator down to the leaf Operator, this part of the stacktrace gives
 * visibility into what all of the actions that we expect to happen from the operator chain are
 * 2. All of the push() calls up until the exception happens, this part of the stack trace gives us a view of all
 * of the things that have happened to the data up until the exception was thrown.
 * <p>
 * This "hour glass" structure of the stacktrace is by design.  It is very important that implementations of this
 * interface never resort to a fluent style, inheritance or other code structuring that removes the name of the active
 * Operator from the stacktrace.  It should always be possible to find ways to avoid code duplication and still keep
 * the Operator's name on the stacktrace.
 * <p>
 * The other benefit of the go() method is that it fully encapsulates the lifecycle of the underlying resources.
 * This means that it should be possible to use try/finally blocks around calls to go() in order to ensure that
 * resources are properly closed.
