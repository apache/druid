 * only when aggregation for the grouping key correspoing to that slot is finished.  Since the reading and writing
 * threads cannot access the same array slot at the same time, they can read/write data without contention.
 *
 * This class uses the spinlock for waiting for at least one slot to become available when the array is empty or full.
 * If the array is empty, the reading thread waits for the aggregation for an array slot is finished.  If the array is
