/**
 * An interface representing a chunk of RowsAndColumns.  Essentially a RowsAndColumns is just a batch of rows
 * with columns.
 * <p>
 * This interface has very little prescriptively defined about what *must* be implemented.  This is intentional
 * as there are lots of different possible representations of batch of rows each with their own unique positives
 * and negatives when it comes to processing.  So, any explicit definition of what a RowsAndColumns is will actually,
 * by definition, end up as optimal for one specific configuration and sub-optimal for others.  Instead of trying to
 * explicitly expand the interface to cover all the different possible ways that someone could want to interace
 * with a Rows and columns, we rely on semantic interfaces using the {@link RowsAndColumns#as} method instead.
 * <p>
 * That is, the expectation is that anything that works with a RowsAndColumns will tend to first ask the RowsAndColumns
 * object to become some other interface, for example, an {@link OnHeapAggregatable}.  If a RowsAndColumns knows how
 * to do a good job as the requested interface, it can return its own concrete implementation of the interface and
 * run the necessary logic in its own optimized fashion.  If the RowsAndColumns instance does not know how to implement
 * the semantic interface, it is expected that a default implementation of the interface can be instantiated on top of
 * the default column access mechanisms that the RowsAndColumns provides.  Such default implementations should be
 * functionally correct, but are not believed to be optimal.
 * <p>
 * The "default column access mechanisms" here amount to using {@link #findColumn} to load a Column
 * and then using {@link Column#toAccessor} to access the individual cells of the column.  There is also a
 * {@link Column#as} method which a default implementation might attempt to use to create a more optimal runtime.
 * <p>
 * It is intended that this interface can be used by Frames, Segments and even normal on-heap JVM data structures to
 * participate in query operations.
