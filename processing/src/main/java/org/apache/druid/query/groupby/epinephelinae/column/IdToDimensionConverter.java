 * Encoding
 * 1. {@link DimensionToIdConverter} extracts the multi-value holder for the given row, which get's stored somewhere
 * 2. For each entry in the multi-value object, the value gets encoded into a dictionaryId, using {@link DimensionToIdConverter#lookupId}
 * 3. The callers can use this integer dictionaryID to materialize the results somewhere
 *
 * Decoding
 * 1. The materialized dictionary id is deserialized back to an int, and then decoded into value using {@link #idToKey}
 *
 * @see DimensionToIdConverter for converting the dimensions to dictionary ids
 *
 * @param <DimensionType> Type of the dimension's values
