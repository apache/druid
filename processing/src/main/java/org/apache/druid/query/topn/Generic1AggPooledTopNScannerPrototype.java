   *
   * It should be checked with a tool like https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/jitwatch that C2 compiler output for this
   * method doesn't have any method calls in the while loop, i. e. all method calls are inlined. To be able to see
   * assembly of this method in JITWatch and other similar tools, {@link
   * PooledTopNAlgorithm#specializeGeneric1AggPooledTopN} should be turned off. Note that in this case the benchmark
   * should be "naturally monomorphic", i. e. execute this method always with the same runtime shape.
   *
   * If the while loop contains not inlined method calls, it should be considered as a performance bug.
