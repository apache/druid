/**
 * A semantic interface used to aggregate a list of AggregatorFactories across a given set of data

 * The aggregation specifically happens on-heap and should be used in places where it is known that the data
 * set can be worked with entirely on-heap.  There is support for frame definitions, frames aggregate certain
 * subsets of rows in a rolling fashion like a windowed average.  Frames are defined in terms of boundaries
 * where a boundary could be based on rows or it could be based on "PEER" groupings.
 * <p>
 * A peer grouping is defined as a set of rows that are the same based on the ORDER BY columns specified.  As such
 * peer-grouped values must also come with a set of ORDER BY columns.
