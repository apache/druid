/**
 * Denotes the ascending-descending run lengths of the fields of the keycolumns that can be compared together.
 * It analyses the key columns and their types. It coalesces the adjacent key columns if they are:
 * a. Byte comparable, i.e. the fields won't need to be deserialized before comparing. It doesn't care about the types
 * b. Have same order
 *
 * All the primitive and the primitive arrays are byte comparable. The complex types are not byte comparable, and nested arrays
 * and arrays of complex objects are not supported by MSQ right now.
 *
 * Consider a row with the key columns like:
 *
 * ColumnName       ColumnType        Order
 * ==========================================
 * longAsc1         LONG              ASC
 * stringAsc1       STRING            ASC
 * stringDesc1      STRING            DESC
 * longDesc1        LONG              DESC
 * complexDesc1     COMPLEX           DESC
 * complexAsc1      COMPLEX           ASC
 * complexAsc2      COMPLEX           ASC
 * stringAsc2       STRING            ASC
 *
 * The run lengths generated would be:
 *
 * RunLengthEntry        Run length   Order     Is byte comparable    Explanation
 * ====================================================================================================================
 * RunLengthEntry#1      2            ASC       true                  Even though longAsc1 and stringAsc1 had different types,
 *                                                                    both types are byte comparable and have same direction. Therefore,
 *                                                                    they can be byte-compared together
 *
 * RunLengthEntry#2      2            DESC      true                  stringDesc1 can't be clubed with the previous stringAsc1 due to
 *                                                                    different ordering. It is clubbed with the following longDesc1 due
 *                                                                    to the reason stated above
 * RunLengthEntry#3      1            DESC      false                 Non byte comparable types cannot be clubbed with anything
 * RunLengthEntry#4      1            ASC       false                 Non byte comparable types cannot be clubbed with anything
 * RunLengthEntry#5      1            ASC       false                 Non byte comparable types cannot be clubbed with anything despite
 *                                                                    the previous key column having same order and the type
 * RunLengthEntry#6      1            ASC       true                  Cannot be clubbed with previous entry. It is own entry
