   * This is an undocumented option provided as a transition tool:
   *
   * The join filter rewrites originally performed the pre-analysis phase prior to any per-segment processing,
   * analyzing only the filter in the top-level of the query.
   *
   * This did not work for nested queries (see https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9978), so the rewrite pre-analysis
   * was moved into the cursor creation of the {@link org.apache.druid.segment.join.HashJoinSegmentStorageAdapter}.
   * This design requires synchronization across multiple segment processing threads; the old rewrite mode
   * is kept temporarily available in case issues arise with the new mode, and the user does not run queries with the
   * affected nested shape.
