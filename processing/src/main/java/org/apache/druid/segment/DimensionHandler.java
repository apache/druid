/**
 * Processing related interface
 *
 * A DimensionHandler is an object that encapsulates indexing, column merging/building, and querying operations
 * for a given dimension type (e.g., dict-encoded String, Long).
 *
 * These operations are handled by sub-objects created through a DimensionHandler's methods:
 *   DimensionIndexer, DimensionMerger, and DimensionColumnReader, respectively.
 *
 * Each DimensionHandler object is associated with a single dimension.
 *
 * This interface allows type-specific behavior column logic, such as choice of indexing structures and disk formats.
 * to be contained within a type-specific set of handler objects, simplifying processing classes
 * such as {@link org.apache.druid.segment.incremental.IncrementalIndex} and {@link IndexMerger} and allowing for abstracted
 * development of additional dimension types.
 *
 * A DimensionHandler is a stateless object, and thus thread-safe; its methods should be pure functions.
 *
 * The EncodedType and ActualType are Comparable because columns used as dimensions must have sortable values.
 *
 * @param <EncodedType> class of a single encoded value
 * @param <EncodedKeyComponentType> A row key contains a component for each dimension, this param specifies the
 *                                 class of this dimension's key component. A column type that supports multivalue rows
 *                                 should use an array type (Strings would use int[]). Column types without multivalue
 *                                 row support should use single objects (e.g., Long, Float).
 * @param <ActualType> class of a single actual value
