/**
 * Common {@link BitmapColumnIndex} implementation for indexes which are computed by scanning the entire value
 * dictionary of the underlying column to check if the value index matches the filter. Contains logic to skip computing
 * indexes with {@link #computeBitmapResult(BitmapResultFactory, int, int, boolean)} if 'selectionRowCount' does not
 * equal 'totalRowCount' and 'selectionRowCount' is smaller than {@link #dictionarySize} multiplied by
 * {@link #scaleThreshold}. The default {@link #scaleThreshold} value is 1.0, meaning that if {@link #dictionarySize}
 * is larger than 'selectionRowCount' we skip using indexes, the idea being we would either have to perform the check
 * against the values in the dictionary or the values in the remaining rows, since remaining rows is smaller we should
 * just do that instead of spending time to compute indexes to further shrink 'selectionRowCount'.
