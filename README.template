Apache Druid (incubating) is a high performance analytics data store for event-driven data. More information about Druid
can be found on http://www.druid.io.

The Druid community is in the process of migrating to Apache by way of the Apache Incubator. Eventually, as we proceed
along this path, our site will move from http://druid.io/ to https://druid.apache.org/.


Documentation
-------------
You can find the documentation for {THIS_OR_THE_LATEST} Druid release on the project website http://druid.io/docs/{DRUIDVERSION}/.

You can get started with Druid with our quickstart at http://druid.io/docs/{DRUIDVERSION}/tutorials/quickstart.html.


Build from Source
-----------------
You can build Apache Druid (incubating) directly from source.

Prerequisites:
  JDK 8, 8u92+
  Maven version 3.x


The basic command to build Druid from source is:

    mvn clean install


This will run static analysis, unit tests, compile classes, and package the projects into JARs. It will not generate the
source or binary distribution tarball.

In addition to the basic stages, you may also want to add the following profiles and properties:

  -Pdist           - Distribution profile: Generates the binary distribution tarball by pulling in core extensions and
                     dependencies and packaging the files as 'distribution/target/apache-druid-x.x.x-bin.tar.gz'
  -Papache-release - Apache release profile: Generates GPG signature and checksums, and builds the source distribution
                     tarball as `distribution/target/apache-druid-x.x.x-src.tar.gz`
  -Prat            - Apache Rat profile: Runs the Apache Rat license audit tool
  -DskipTests      - Skips unit tests (which reduces build time)

Putting these together, if you wish to build the source and binary distributions with signatures and checksums, audit
licenses, and skip the unit tests, you would run:

    mvn clean install -Papache-release,dist,rat -DskipTests

Note: the AWS S3 unit tests require the 'AWS_DEFAULT_REGION' environment variable to be set to function correctly.

Disclaimer: Apache Druid is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the
Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful
ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it
does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
