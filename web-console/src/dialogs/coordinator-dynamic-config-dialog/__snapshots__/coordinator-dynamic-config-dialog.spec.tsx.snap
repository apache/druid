            The maximum number of segments that could be queued for loading to any given server. This parameter could be used to speed up segments loading process, especially if there are "slow" nodes in the cluster (with low loading speed) or if too much segments scheduled to be replicated to some particular node (faster loading could be preferred to better segments distribution). Desired value depends on segments loading speed, acceptable replication time and number of nodes. Value 1000 could be a start point for a rather big cluster. Default value is 0 (loading queue is unbounded)

            List of historical services to 'decommission'. Coordinator will not assign new segments to 'decommissioning' services, and segments will be moved away from them to be placed on non-decommissioning services at the maximum rate specified by

            The maximum number of segments that may be moved away from 'decommissioning' services to non-decommissioning (that is, active) services during one Coordinator run. This value is relative to the total maximum segment movements allowed during one run which is determined by

              maxSegmentsToMove

              decommissioningMaxPercentOfMaxSegmentsToMove
            </Unknown>
             is 0, segments will neither be moved from or to 'decommissioning' services, effectively putting them in a sort of "maintenance" mode that will not participate in balancing or assignment by load rules. Decommissioning can also become stalled if there are no available active services to place the segments. By leveraging the maximum percent of decommissioning segment movements, an operator can prevent active services from overload by prioritizing balancing, or decrease decommissioning time instead. The value should be between 0 and 100.
