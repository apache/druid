            The maximum number of segments that could be queued for loading to any given server. This parameter could be used to speed up segments loading process, especially if there are "slow" nodes in the cluster (with low loading speed) or if too much segments scheduled to be replicated to some particular node (faster loading could be preferred to better segments distribution). Desired value depends on segments loading speed, acceptable replication time and number of nodes. Value 1000 could be a start point for a rather big cluster. Default value is 0 (loading queue is unbounded)

            The maximum number of segments that may be moved away from 'decommissioning' services to non-decommissioning (that is, active) services during one Coordinator run. This value is relative to the total maximum segment movements allowed during one run which is determined by

              decommissioningMaxPercentOfMaxSegmentsToMove
            </Unknown>
             is 0, segments will neither be moved from or to 'decommissioning' services, effectively putting them in a sort of "maintenance" mode that will not participate in balancing or assignment by load rules. Decommissioning can also become stalled if there are no available active services to place the segments. By leveraging the maximum percent of decommissioning segment movements, an operator can prevent active services from overload by prioritizing balancing, or decrease decommissioning time instead. The value should be between 0 and 100.

          "info": <React.Fragment>
            The percentage of the total number of segments in the cluster that are considered every time a segment needs to be selected for a move. Druid orders servers by available capacity ascending (the least available capacity first) and then iterates over the servers. For each server, Druid iterates over the segments on the server, considering them for moving. The default config of 100% means that every segment on every server is a candidate to be moved. This should make sense for most small to medium-sized clusters. However, an admin may find it preferable to drop this value lower if they don't think that it is worthwhile to consider every single segment in the cluster each time it is looking for a segment to move.

          "info": <React.Fragment>
            Boolean flag for whether or not the coordinator should execute its various duties of coordinating the cluster. Setting this to true essentially pauses all coordination work while allowing the API to remain up.
