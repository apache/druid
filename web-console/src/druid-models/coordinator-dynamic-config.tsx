        moved from or to 'decommissioning' services, effectively putting them in a sort of
        "maintenance" mode that will not participate in balancing or assignment by load rules.
        Decommissioning can also become stalled if there are no available active services to place
        the segments. By leveraging the maximum percent of decommissioning segment movements, an
        operator can prevent active services from overload by prioritizing balancing, or decrease
        decommissioning time instead. The value should be between 0 and 100.
