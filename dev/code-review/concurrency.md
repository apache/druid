<hr>

<a name="use-lifecycle-lock"></a>
[#](#use-lifecycle-lock) Lk.D1. Is it possible to use Druid's `LifecycleLock` utility instead of a standard lock and
"started" flag in lifecycled objects with `start()` and `stop()` methods? See the Javadoc comment for `LifecycleLock`
for more details.

<a name="daemon-threads"></a>
[#](#daemon-threads) TE.D1. Are Threads created directly or via a `ThreadFactory` configured to be daemon via
`setDaemon(true)`? Note that by default, ThreadFactories constructed via `Execs.makeThreadFactory()` methods create
daemon threads already.

<a name="use-execs"></a>
[#](#use-execs) TE.D2. Is it possible to use one of the static factory methods in Druid's `Execs` utility class to
create an `ExecutorService` instead of Java's standard `ExecutorServices`? This is recommended because `Execs` configure
ThreadFactories to create daemon threads by default, as required by the previous item.
